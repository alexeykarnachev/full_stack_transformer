{"body": "SUPPOSING that Truth is a woman--what then? Is there not ground\nfor suspecting that all philosophers, in so far as they have been\ndogmatists, have failed to understand women--that the terrible\nseriousness and clumsy importunity with which they have usually paid\ntheir addresses to Truth, have been unskilled and unseemly methods for\nwinning a woman? Certainly she has never allowed herself to be won; and\nat present every kind of dogma stands with sad and discouraged mien--IF,\nindeed, it stands at all! For there are scoffers who maintain that it\nhas fallen, that all dogma lies on the ground--nay more, that it is at\nits last gasp. But to speak seriously, there are good grounds for hoping\nthat all dogmatizing in philosophy, whatever solemn, whatever conclusive\nand decided airs it has assumed, may have been only a noble puerilism\nand tyronism; and probably the time is at hand when it will be once\nand again understood WHAT has actually sufficed for the basis of such\nimposing and absolute philosophical edifices as the dogmatists have\nhitherto reared: perhaps some popular superstition of immemorial time\n(such as the soul-superstition, which, in the form of subject- and\nego-superstition, has not yet ceased doing mischief): perhaps some\nplay upon words, a deception on the part of grammar, or an\naudacious generalization of very restricted, very personal, very\nhuman--all-too-human facts. The philosophy of the dogmatists, it is to\nbe hoped, was only a promise for thousands of years afterwards, as was\nastrology in still earlier times, in the service of which probably more\nlabour, gold, acuteness, and patience have been spent than on any\nactual science hitherto: we owe to it, and to its \"super-terrestrial\"\npretensions in Asia and Egypt, the grand style of architecture. It seems\nthat in order to inscribe themselves upon the heart of humanity with\neverlasting claims, all great things have first to wander about the\nearth as enormous and awe-inspiring caricatures: dogmatic philosophy has\nbeen a caricature of this kind--for instance, the Vedanta doctrine in\nAsia, and Platonism in Europe. Let us not be ungrateful to it, although\nit must certainly be confessed that the worst, the most tiresome,\nand the most dangerous of errors hitherto has been a dogmatist\nerror--namely, Plato's invention of Pure Spirit and the Good in Itself.\nBut now when it has been surmounted, when Europe, rid of this nightmare,\ncan again draw breath freely and at least enjoy a healthier--sleep,\nwe, WHOSE DUTY IS WAKEFULNESS ITSELF, are the heirs of all the strength\nwhich the struggle against this error has fostered. It amounted to\nthe very inversion of truth, and the denial of the PERSPECTIVE--the\nfundamental condition--of life, to speak of Spirit and the Good as Plato\nspoke of them; indeed one might ask, as a physician: \"How did such a\nmalady attack that finest product of antiquity, Plato? Had the wicked\nSocrates really corrupted him? Was Socrates after all a corrupter of\nyouths, and deserved his hemlock?\" But the struggle against Plato,\nor--to speak plainer, and for the \"people\"--the struggle against\nthe ecclesiastical oppression of millenniums of Christianity (FOR\nCHRISTIANITY IS PLATONISM FOR THE \"PEOPLE\"), produced in Europe\na magnificent tension of soul, such as had not existed anywhere\npreviously; with such a tensely strained bow one can now aim at the\nfurthest goals. As a matter of fact, the European feels this tension as\na state of distress, and twice attempts have been made in grand style to\nunbend the bow: once by means of Jesuitism, and the second time by means\nof democratic enlightenment--which, with the aid of liberty of the press\nand newspaper-reading, might, in fact, bring it about that the spirit\nwould not so easily find itself in \"distress\"! (The Germans invented\ngunpowder--all credit to them! but they again made things square--they\ninvented printing.) But we, who are neither Jesuits, nor democrats,\nnor even sufficiently Germans, we GOOD EUROPEANS, and free, VERY free\nspirits--we have it still, all the distress of spirit and all the\ntension of its bow! And perhaps also the arrow, the duty, and, who\nknows? THE GOAL TO AIM AT....\n"}

{"body": "1. The Will to Truth, which is to tempt us to many a hazardous\nenterprise, the famous Truthfulness of which all philosophers have\nhitherto spoken with respect, what questions has this Will to Truth not\nlaid before us! What strange, perplexing, questionable questions! It is\nalready a long story; yet it seems as if it were hardly commenced. Is\nit any wonder if we at last grow distrustful, lose patience, and turn\nimpatiently away? That this Sphinx teaches us at last to ask questions\nourselves? WHO is it really that puts questions to us here? WHAT really\nis this \"Will to Truth\" in us? In fact we made a long halt at the\nquestion as to the origin of this Will--until at last we came to an\nabsolute standstill before a yet more fundamental question. We inquired\nabout the VALUE of this Will. Granted that we want the truth: WHY NOT\nRATHER untruth? And uncertainty? Even ignorance? The problem of the\nvalue of truth presented itself before us--or was it we who presented\nourselves before the problem? Which of us is the Oedipus here? Which\nthe Sphinx? It would seem to be a rendezvous of questions and notes of\ninterrogation. And could it be believed that it at last seems to us as\nif the problem had never been propounded before, as if we were the first\nto discern it, get a sight of it, and RISK RAISING it? For there is risk\nin raising it, perhaps there is no greater risk.\n"}
{"body": "2. \"HOW COULD anything originate out of its opposite? For example, truth\nout of error? or the Will to Truth out of the will to deception? or the\ngenerous deed out of selfishness? or the pure sun-bright vision of the\nwise man out of covetousness? Such genesis is impossible; whoever dreams\nof it is a fool, nay, worse than a fool; things of the highest\nvalue must have a different origin, an origin of THEIR own--in this\ntransitory, seductive, illusory, paltry world, in this turmoil of\ndelusion and cupidity, they cannot have their source. But rather in\nthe lap of Being, in the intransitory, in the concealed God, in the\n'Thing-in-itself--THERE must be their source, and nowhere else!\"--This\nmode of reasoning discloses the typical prejudice by which\nmetaphysicians of all times can be recognized, this mode of valuation\nis at the back of all their logical procedure; through this \"belief\" of\ntheirs, they exert themselves for their \"knowledge,\" for something that\nis in the end solemnly christened \"the Truth.\" The fundamental belief of\nmetaphysicians is THE BELIEF IN ANTITHESES OF VALUES. It never occurred\neven to the wariest of them to doubt here on the very threshold (where\ndoubt, however, was most necessary); though they had made a solemn\nvow, \"DE OMNIBUS DUBITANDUM.\" For it may be doubted, firstly, whether\nantitheses exist at all; and secondly, whether the popular valuations\nand antitheses of value upon which metaphysicians have set their\nseal, are not perhaps merely superficial estimates, merely provisional\nperspectives, besides being probably made from some corner, perhaps from\nbelow--\"frog perspectives,\" as it were, to borrow an expression current\namong painters. In spite of all the value which may belong to the true,\nthe positive, and the unselfish, it might be possible that a higher\nand more fundamental value for life generally should be assigned to\npretence, to the will to delusion, to selfishness, and cupidity. It\nmight even be possible that WHAT constitutes the value of those good and\nrespected things, consists precisely in their being insidiously\nrelated, knotted, and crocheted to these evil and apparently opposed\nthings--perhaps even in being essentially identical with them. Perhaps!\nBut who wishes to concern himself with such dangerous \"Perhapses\"!\nFor that investigation one must await the advent of a new order of\nphilosophers, such as will have other tastes and inclinations, the\nreverse of those hitherto prevalent--philosophers of the dangerous\n\"Perhaps\" in every sense of the term. And to speak in all seriousness, I\nsee such new philosophers beginning to appear.\n"}
{"body": "3. Having kept a sharp eye on philosophers, and having read between\ntheir lines long enough, I now say to myself that the greater part of\nconscious thinking must be counted among the instinctive functions, and\nit is so even in the case of philosophical thinking; one has here to\nlearn anew, as one learned anew about heredity and \"innateness.\" As\nlittle as the act of birth comes into consideration in the whole process\nand procedure of heredity, just as little is \"being-conscious\" OPPOSED\nto the instinctive in any decisive sense; the greater part of the\nconscious thinking of a philosopher is secretly influenced by his\ninstincts, and forced into definite channels. And behind all logic and\nits seeming sovereignty of movement, there are valuations, or to speak\nmore plainly, physiological demands, for the maintenance of a definite\nmode of life For example, that the certain is worth more than the\nuncertain, that illusion is less valuable than \"truth\" such valuations,\nin spite of their regulative importance for US, might notwithstanding be\nonly superficial valuations, special kinds of _niaiserie_, such as may\nbe necessary for the maintenance of beings such as ourselves. Supposing,\nin effect, that man is not just the \"measure of things.\"\n"}
{"body": "4. The falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it: it is\nhere, perhaps, that our new language sounds most strangely. The\nquestion is, how far an opinion is life-furthering, life-preserving,\nspecies-preserving, perhaps species-rearing, and we are fundamentally\ninclined to maintain that the falsest opinions (to which the synthetic\njudgments a priori belong), are the most indispensable to us, that\nwithout a recognition of logical fictions, without a comparison of\nreality with the purely IMAGINED world of the absolute and immutable,\nwithout a constant counterfeiting of the world by means of numbers,\nman could not live--that the renunciation of false opinions would be\na renunciation of life, a negation of life. TO RECOGNISE UNTRUTH AS A\nCONDITION OF LIFE; that is certainly to impugn the traditional ideas of\nvalue in a dangerous manner, and a philosophy which ventures to do so,\nhas thereby alone placed itself beyond good and evil.\n"}
{"body": "5. That which causes philosophers to be regarded half-distrustfully\nand half-mockingly, is not the oft-repeated discovery how innocent they\nare--how often and easily they make mistakes and lose their way, in\nshort, how childish and childlike they are,--but that there is not\nenough honest dealing with them, whereas they all raise a loud and\nvirtuous outcry when the problem of truthfulness is even hinted at in\nthe remotest manner. They all pose as though their real opinions had\nbeen discovered and attained through the self-evolving of a cold, pure,\ndivinely indifferent dialectic (in contrast to all sorts of mystics,\nwho, fairer and foolisher, talk of \"inspiration\"), whereas, in fact, a\nprejudiced proposition, idea, or \"suggestion,\" which is generally\ntheir heart's desire abstracted and refined, is defended by them with\narguments sought out after the event. They are all advocates who do not\nwish to be regarded as such, generally astute defenders, also, of their\nprejudices, which they dub \"truths,\"--and VERY far from having the\nconscience which bravely admits this to itself, very far from having\nthe good taste of the courage which goes so far as to let this be\nunderstood, perhaps to warn friend or foe, or in cheerful confidence\nand self-ridicule. The spectacle of the Tartuffery of old Kant, equally\nstiff and decent, with which he entices us into the dialectic\nby-ways that lead (more correctly mislead) to his \"categorical\nimperative\"--makes us fastidious ones smile, we who find no small\namusement in spying out the subtle tricks of old moralists and ethical\npreachers. Or, still more so, the hocus-pocus in mathematical form, by\nmeans of which Spinoza has, as it were, clad his philosophy in mail and\nmask--in fact, the \"love of HIS wisdom,\" to translate the term fairly\nand squarely--in order thereby to strike terror at once into the heart\nof the assailant who should dare to cast a glance on that invincible\nmaiden, that Pallas Athene:--how much of personal timidity and\nvulnerability does this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray!\n"}
{"body": "6. It has gradually become clear to me what every great philosophy up\ntill now has consisted of--namely, the confession of its originator, and\na species of involuntary and unconscious auto-biography; and moreover\nthat the moral (or immoral) purpose in every philosophy has constituted\nthe true vital germ out of which the entire plant has always grown.\nIndeed, to understand how the abstrusest metaphysical assertions of a\nphilosopher have been arrived at, it is always well (and wise) to first\nask oneself: \"What morality do they (or does he) aim at?\" Accordingly,\nI do not believe that an \"impulse to knowledge\" is the father of\nphilosophy; but that another impulse, here as elsewhere, has only made\nuse of knowledge (and mistaken knowledge!) as an instrument. But whoever\nconsiders the fundamental impulses of man with a view to determining\nhow far they may have here acted as INSPIRING GENII (or as demons and\ncobolds), will find that they have all practiced philosophy at one time\nor another, and that each one of them would have been only too glad to\nlook upon itself as the ultimate end of existence and the legitimate\nLORD over all the other impulses. For every impulse is imperious, and as\nSUCH, attempts to philosophize. To be sure, in the case of scholars, in\nthe case of really scientific men, it may be otherwise--\"better,\" if\nyou will; there there may really be such a thing as an \"impulse to\nknowledge,\" some kind of small, independent clock-work, which, when well\nwound up, works away industriously to that end, WITHOUT the rest of\nthe scholarly impulses taking any material part therein. The actual\n\"interests\" of the scholar, therefore, are generally in quite another\ndirection--in the family, perhaps, or in money-making, or in politics;\nit is, in fact, almost indifferent at what point of research his little\nmachine is placed, and whether the hopeful young worker becomes a\ngood philologist, a mushroom specialist, or a chemist; he is not\nCHARACTERISED by becoming this or that. In the philosopher, on the\ncontrary, there is absolutely nothing impersonal; and above all,\nhis morality furnishes a decided and decisive testimony as to WHO HE\nIS,--that is to say, in what order the deepest impulses of his nature\nstand to each other.\n"}
{"body": "7. How malicious philosophers can be! I know of nothing more stinging\nthan the joke Epicurus took the liberty of making on Plato and the\nPlatonists; he called them Dionysiokolakes. In its original sense,\nand on the face of it, the word signifies \"Flatterers of\nDionysius\"--consequently, tyrants' accessories and lick-spittles;\nbesides this, however, it is as much as to say, \"They are all ACTORS,\nthere is nothing genuine about them\" (for Dionysiokolax was a popular\nname for an actor). And the latter is really the malignant reproach that\nEpicurus cast upon Plato: he was annoyed by the grandiose manner, the\nmise en scene style of which Plato and his scholars were masters--of\nwhich Epicurus was not a master! He, the old school-teacher of Samos,\nwho sat concealed in his little garden at Athens, and wrote three\nhundred books, perhaps out of rage and ambitious envy of Plato, who\nknows! Greece took a hundred years to find out who the garden-god\nEpicurus really was. Did she ever find out?\n"}

Imagine to yourselves a being like Nature, boundlessly\nextravagant, boundlessly indifferent, without purpose or consideration,\nwithout pity or justice, at once fruitful and barren and uncertain:\nimagine to yourselves INDIFFERENCE as a power--how COULD you live\nin accordance with such indifference? To live--is not that just\nendeavouring to be otherwise than this Nature? Is not living valuing,\npreferring, being unjust, being limited, endeavouring to be different?\nAnd granted that your imperative, \"living according to Nature,\" means\nactually the same as \"living according to life\"--how could you do\nDIFFERENTLY? Why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves\nare, and must be? In reality, however, it is quite otherwise with you:\nwhile you pretend to read with rapture the canon of your law in Nature,\nyou want something quite the contrary, you extraordinary stage-players\nand self-deluders! In your pride you wish to dictate your morals and\nideals to Nature, to Nature herself, and to incorporate them therein;\nyou insist that it shall be Nature \"according to the Stoa,\" and would\nlike everything to be made after your own image, as a vast, eternal\nglorification and generalism of Stoicism! With all your love for truth,\nyou have forced yourselves so long, so persistently, and with such\nhypnotic rigidity to see Nature FALSELY, that is to say, Stoically,\nthat you are no longer able to see it otherwise--and to crown all, some\nunfathomable superciliousness gives you the Bedlamite hope that\nBECAUSE you are able to tyrannize over yourselves--Stoicism is\nself-tyranny--Nature will also allow herself to be tyrannized over: is\nnot the Stoic a PART of Nature?... But this is an old and everlasting\nstory: what happened in old times with the Stoics still happens today,\nas soon as ever a philosophy begins to believe in itself. It always\ncreates the world in its own image; it cannot do otherwise; philosophy\nis this tyrannical impulse itself, the most spiritual Will to Power, the\nwill to \"creation of the world,\" the will to the causa prima.\n"}
{"body": "10. The eagerness and subtlety, I should even say craftiness, with\nwhich the problem of \"the real and the apparent world\" is dealt with at\npresent throughout Europe, furnishes food for thought and attention; and\nhe who hears only a \"Will to Truth\" in the background, and nothing else,\ncannot certainly boast of the sharpest ears. In rare and isolated\ncases, it may really have happened that such a Will to Truth--a certain\nextravagant and adventurous pluck, a metaphysician's ambition of the\nforlorn hope--has participated therein: that which in the end always\nprefers a handful of \"certainty\" to a whole cartload of beautiful\npossibilities; there may even be puritanical fanatics of conscience,\nwho prefer to put their last trust in a sure nothing, rather than in an\nuncertain something. But that is Nihilism, and the sign of a despairing,\nmortally wearied soul, notwithstanding the courageous bearing such a\nvirtue may display. It seems, however, to be otherwise with stronger\nand livelier thinkers who are still eager for life. In that they side\nAGAINST appearance, and speak superciliously of \"perspective,\" in\nthat they rank the credibility of their own bodies about as low as the\ncredibility of the ocular evidence that \"the earth stands still,\" and\nthus, apparently, allowing with complacency their securest possession\nto escape (for what does one at present believe in more firmly than\nin one's body?),--who knows if they are not really trying to win back\nsomething which was formerly an even securer possession, something\nof the old domain of the faith of former times, perhaps the \"immortal\nsoul,\" perhaps \"the old God,\" in short, ideas by which they could live\nbetter, that is to say, more vigorously and more joyously, than by\n\"modern ideas\"? There is DISTRUST of these modern ideas in this mode\nof looking at things, a disbelief in all that has been constructed\nyesterday and today; there is perhaps some slight admixture of satiety\nand scorn, which can no longer endure the BRIC-A-BRAC of ideas of the\nmost varied origin, such as so-called Positivism at present throws on\nthe market; a disgust of the more refined taste at the village-fair\nmotleyness and patchiness of all these reality-philosophasters, in whom\nthere is nothing either new or true, except this motleyness. Therein it\nseems to me that we should agree with those skeptical anti-realists and\nknowledge-microscopists of the present day; their instinct, which repels\nthem from MODERN reality, is unrefuted... what do their retrograde\nby-paths concern us! The main thing about them is NOT that they wish\nto go \"back,\" but that they wish to get AWAY therefrom. A little MORE\nstrength, swing, courage, and artistic power, and they would be OFF--and\nnot back!\n"}
{"body": "11. It seems to me that there is everywhere an attempt at present to\ndivert attention from the actual influence which Kant exercised on\nGerman philosophy, and especially to ignore prudently the value which\nhe set upon himself. Kant was first and foremost proud of his Table of\nCategories; with it in his hand he said: \"This is the most difficult\nthing that could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics.\" Let us\nonly understand this \"could be\"! He was proud of having DISCOVERED a\nnew faculty in man, the faculty of synthetic judgment a priori. Granting\nthat he deceived himself in this matter; the development and rapid\nflourishing of German philosophy depended nevertheless on his pride, and\non the eager rivalry of the younger generation to discover if possible\nsomething--at all events \"new faculties\"--of which to be still\nprouder!--But let us reflect for a moment--it is high time to do so.\n\"How are synthetic judgments a priori POSSIBLE?\" Kant asks himself--and\nwhat is really his answer? \"BY MEANS OF A MEANS (faculty)\"--but\nunfortunately not in five words, but so circumstantially, imposingly,\nand with such display of German profundity and verbal flourishes, that\none altogether loses sight of the comical niaiserie allemande involved\nin such an answer. People were beside themselves with delight over this\nnew faculty, and the jubilation reached its climax when Kant further\ndiscovered a moral faculty in man--for at that time Germans were still\nmoral, not yet dabbling in the \"Politics of hard fact.\" Then came\nthe honeymoon of German philosophy. All the young theologians of the\nTubingen institution went immediately into the groves--all seeking for\n\"faculties.\" And what did they not find--in that innocent, rich, and\nstill youthful period of the German spirit, to which Romanticism, the\nmalicious fairy, piped and sang, when one could not yet distinguish\nbetween \"finding\" and \"inventing\"! Above all a faculty for the\n\"transcendental\"; Schelling christened it, intellectual intuition,\nand thereby gratified the most earnest longings of the naturally\npious-inclined Germans. One can do no greater wrong to the whole of\nthis exuberant and eccentric movement (which was really youthfulness,\nnotwithstanding that it disguised itself so boldly, in hoary and senile\nconceptions), than to take it seriously, or even treat it with moral\nindignation. Enough, however--the world grew older, and the dream\nvanished. A time came when people rubbed their foreheads, and they still\nrub them today. People had been dreaming, and first and foremost--old\nKant. \"By means of a means (faculty)\"--he had said, or at least meant to\nsay. But, is that--an answer? An explanation? Or is it not rather merely\na repetition of the question? How does opium induce sleep? \"By means of\na means (faculty),\" namely the virtus dormitiva, replies the doctor in\nMoliere,\n"}

{"body": "But such replies belong to the realm of comedy, and it is high time\nto replace the Kantian question, \"How are synthetic judgments a PRIORI\npossible?\" by another question, \"Why is belief in such judgments\nnecessary?\"--in effect, it is high time that we should understand\nthat such judgments must be believed to be true, for the sake of the\npreservation of creatures like ourselves; though they still might\nnaturally be false judgments! Or, more plainly spoken, and roughly and\nreadily--synthetic judgments a priori should not \"be possible\" at all;\nwe have no right to them; in our mouths they are nothing but false\njudgments. Only, of course, the belief in their truth is necessary, as\nplausible belief and ocular evidence belonging to the perspective view\nof life. And finally, to call to mind the enormous influence which\n\"German philosophy\"--I hope you understand its right to inverted commas\n(goosefeet)?--has exercised throughout the whole of Europe, there is\nno doubt that a certain VIRTUS DORMITIVA had a share in it; thanks to\nGerman philosophy, it was a delight to the noble idlers, the virtuous,\nthe mystics, the artiste, the three-fourths Christians, and the\npolitical obscurantists of all nations, to find an antidote to the still\noverwhelming sensualism which overflowed from the last century into\nthis, in short--\"sensus assoupire.\"...\n"}
{"body": "12. As regards materialistic atomism, it is one of the best-refuted\ntheories that have been advanced, and in Europe there is now perhaps\nno one in the learned world so unscholarly as to attach serious\nsignification to it, except for convenient everyday use (as an\nabbreviation of the means of expression)--thanks chiefly to the Pole\nBoscovich: he and the Pole Copernicus have hitherto been the greatest\nand most successful opponents of ocular evidence. For while Copernicus\nhas persuaded us to believe, contrary to all the senses, that the earth\ndoes NOT stand fast, Boscovich has taught us to abjure the belief in the\nlast thing that \"stood fast\" of the earth--the belief in \"substance,\" in\n\"matter,\" in the earth-residuum, and particle-atom: it is the greatest\ntriumph over the senses that has hitherto been gained on earth. One\nmust, however, go still further, and also declare war, relentless war\nto the knife, against the \"atomistic requirements\" which still lead a\ndangerous after-life in places where no one suspects them, like the more\ncelebrated \"metaphysical requirements\": one must also above all give\nthe finishing stroke to that other and more portentous atomism which\nChristianity has taught best and longest, the SOUL-ATOMISM. Let it be\npermitted to designate by this expression the belief which regards the\nsoul as something indestructible, eternal, indivisible, as a monad,\nas an atomon: this belief ought to be expelled from science! Between\nourselves, it is not at all necessary to get rid of \"the soul\" thereby,\nand thus renounce one of the oldest and most venerated hypotheses--as\nhappens frequently to the clumsiness of naturalists, who can hardly\ntouch on the soul without immediately losing it. But the way is open\nfor new acceptations and refinements of the soul-hypothesis; and such\nconceptions as \"mortal soul,\" and \"soul of subjective multiplicity,\"\nand \"soul as social structure of the instincts and passions,\" want\nhenceforth to have legitimate rights in science. In that the NEW\npsychologist is about to put an end to the superstitions which have\nhitherto flourished with almost tropical luxuriance around the idea of\nthe soul, he is really, as it were, thrusting himself into a new desert\nand a new distrust--it is possible that the older psychologists had a\nmerrier and more comfortable time of it; eventually, however, he finds\nthat precisely thereby he is also condemned to INVENT--and, who knows?\nperhaps to DISCOVER the new.\n"}

In short, here, as everywhere else,\nlet us beware of SUPERFLUOUS teleological principles!--one of which\nis the instinct of self-preservation (we owe it to Spinoza's\ninconsistency).

Only that which can be seen and\nfelt--one must pursue every problem thus far. Obversely, however, the\ncharm of the Platonic mode of thought, which was an ARISTOCRATIC mode,\nconsisted precisely in RESISTANCE to obvious sense-evidence--perhaps\namong men who enjoyed even stronger and more fastidious senses than our\ncontemporaries, but who knew how to find a higher triumph in remaining\nmasters of them: and this by means of pale, cold, grey conceptional\nnetworks which they threw over the motley whirl of the senses--the\nmob of the senses, as Plato said.

In\nshort, the assertion 'I think,' assumes that I COMPARE my state at the\npresent moment with other states of myself which I know, in order to\ndetermine what it is; on account of this retrospective connection with\nfurther 'knowledge,' it has, at any rate, no immediate certainty for\nme.\"--In place of the \"immediate certainty\" in which the people may\nbelieve in the special case, the philosopher thus finds a series of\nmetaphysical questions presented to him, veritable conscience questions\nof the intellect, to wit: \"Whence did I get the notion of 'thinking'?\nWhy do I believe in cause and effect? What gives me the right to speak\nof an 'ego,' and even of an 'ego' as cause, and finally of an 'ego'\nas cause of thought?\" He who ventures to answer these metaphysical\nquestions at once by an appeal to a sort of INTUITIVE perception, like\nthe person who says, \"I think, and know that this, at least, is\ntrue, actual, and certain\"--will encounter a smile and two notes of\ninterrogation in a philosopher nowadays. \"Sir,\" the philosopher will\nperhaps give him to understand, \"it is improbable that you are not\nmistaken, but why should it be the truth?\"\n"}

One infers here\naccording to the usual grammatical formula--\"To think is an activity;\nevery activity requires an agency that is active; consequently\"... It\nwas pretty much on the same lines that the older atomism sought, besides\nthe operating \"power,\" the material particle wherein it resides and out\nof which it operates--the atom.

{"body": "19. Philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will as though it were\nthe best-known thing in the world; indeed, Schopenhauer has given us\nto understand that the will alone is really known to us, absolutely and\ncompletely known, without deduction or addition. But it again and\nagain seems to me that in this case Schopenhauer also only did what\nphilosophers are in the habit of doing--he seems to have adopted a\nPOPULAR PREJUDICE and exaggerated it. Willing seems to me to be above\nall something COMPLICATED, something that is a unity only in name--and\nit is precisely in a name that popular prejudice lurks, which has got\nthe mastery over the inadequate precautions of philosophers in all ages.\nSo let us for once be more cautious, let us be \"unphilosophical\": let\nus say that in all willing there is firstly a plurality of sensations,\nnamely, the sensation of the condition \"AWAY FROM WHICH we go,\" the\nsensation of the condition \"TOWARDS WHICH we go,\" the sensation of this\n\"FROM\" and \"TOWARDS\" itself, and then besides, an accompanying muscular\nsensation, which, even without our putting in motion \"arms and legs,\"\ncommences its action by force of habit, directly we \"will\" anything.\nTherefore, just as sensations (and indeed many kinds of sensations) are\nto be recognized as ingredients of the will, so, in the second place,\nthinking is also to be recognized; in every act of the will there is\na ruling thought;--and let us not imagine it possible to sever this\nthought from the \"willing,\" as if the will would then remain over!\nIn the third place, the will is not only a complex of sensation and\nthinking, but it is above all an EMOTION, and in fact the emotion of the\ncommand. That which is termed \"freedom of the will\" is essentially the\nemotion of supremacy in respect to him who must obey: \"I am free, 'he'\nmust obey\"--this consciousness is inherent in every will; and equally\nso the straining of the attention, the straight look which fixes itself\nexclusively on one thing, the unconditional judgment that \"this and\nnothing else is necessary now,\" the inward certainty that obedience\nwill be rendered--and whatever else pertains to the position of the\ncommander. A man who WILLS commands something within himself which\nrenders obedience, or which he believes renders obedience. But now let\nus notice what is the strangest thing about the will,--this affair so\nextremely complex, for which the people have only one name. Inasmuch as\nin the given circumstances we are at the same time the commanding AND\nthe obeying parties, and as the obeying party we know the sensations of\nconstraint, impulsion, pressure, resistance, and motion, which usually\ncommence immediately after the act of will; inasmuch as, on the other\nhand, we are accustomed to disregard this duality, and to deceive\nourselves about it by means of the synthetic term \"I\": a whole series\nof erroneous conclusions, and consequently of false judgments about the\nwill itself, has become attached to the act of willing--to such a degree\nthat he who wills believes firmly that willing SUFFICES for action.\nSince in the majority of cases there has only been exercise of will\nwhen the effect of the command--consequently obedience, and therefore\naction--was to be EXPECTED, the APPEARANCE has translated itself into\nthe sentiment, as if there were a NECESSITY OF EFFECT; in a word, he who\nwills believes with a fair amount of certainty that will and action are\nsomehow one; he ascribes the success, the carrying out of the willing,\nto the will itself, and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation\nof power which accompanies all success. \"Freedom of Will\"--that is the\nexpression for the complex state of delight of the person exercising\nvolition, who commands and at the same time identifies himself with\nthe executor of the order--who, as such, enjoys also the triumph over\nobstacles, but thinks within himself that it was really his own will\nthat overcame them. In this way the person exercising volition adds the\nfeelings of delight of his successful executive instruments, the useful\n\"underwills\" or under-souls--indeed, our body is but a social structure\ncomposed of many souls--to his feelings of delight as commander. L'EFFET\nC'EST MOI. what happens here is what happens in every well-constructed\nand happy commonwealth, namely, that the governing class identifies\nitself with the successes of the commonwealth. In all willing it is\nabsolutely a question of commanding and obeying, on the basis, as\nalready said, of a social structure composed of many \"souls\", on which\naccount a philosopher should claim the right to include willing-as-such\nwithin the sphere of morals--regarded as the doctrine of the relations\nof supremacy under which the phenomenon of \"life\" manifests itself.\n"}

Under an invisible spell, they always revolve\nonce more in the same orbit, however independent of each other they\nmay feel themselves with their critical or systematic wills, something\nwithin them leads them, something impels them in definite order the\none after the other--to wit, the innate methodology and relationship\nof their ideas.

In fact, where there is\naffinity of language, owing to the common philosophy of grammar--I mean\nowing to the unconscious domination and guidance of similar grammatical\nfunctions--it cannot but be that everything is prepared at the outset\nfor a similar development and succession of philosophical systems,\njust as the way seems barred against certain other possibilities of\nworld-interpretation. It is highly probable that philosophers within the\ndomain of the Ural-Altaic languages (where the conception of the subject\nis least developed) look otherwise \"into the world,\" and will be\nfound on paths of thought different from those of the Indo-Germans and\nMussulmans, the spell of certain grammatical functions is ultimately\nalso the spell of PHYSIOLOGICAL valuations and racial conditions.--So\nmuch by way of rejecting Locke's superficiality with regard to the\norigin of ideas.\n"}

The CAUSA SUI is the best self-contradiction that has yet been\nconceived, it is a sort of logical violation and unnaturalness; but the\nextravagant pride of man has managed to entangle itself profoundly and\nfrightfully with this very folly. The desire for \"freedom of will\"\nin the superlative, metaphysical sense, such as still holds sway,\nunfortunately, in the minds of the half-educated, the desire to bear\nthe entire and ultimate responsibility for one's actions oneself, and\nto absolve God, the world, ancestors, chance, and society therefrom,\ninvolves nothing less than to be precisely this CAUSA SUI, and, with\nmore than Munchausen daring, to pull oneself up into existence by the\nhair, out of the slough of nothingness. If any one should find out in\nthis manner the crass stupidity of the celebrated conception of \"free\nwill\" and put it out of his head altogether, I beg of him to carry\nhis \"enlightenment\" a step further, and also put out of his head the\ncontrary of this monstrous conception of \"free will\": I mean \"non-free\nwill,\" which is tantamount to a misuse of cause and effect. One\nshould not wrongly MATERIALISE \"cause\" and \"effect,\" as the natural\nphilosophers do (and whoever like them naturalize in thinking at\npresent), according to the prevailing mechanical doltishness which makes\nthe cause press and push until it \"effects\" its end; one should use\n\"cause\" and \"effect\" only as pure CONCEPTIONS, that is to say, as\nconventional fictions for the purpose of designation and mutual\nunderstanding,--NOT for explanation. In \"being-in-itself\" there is\nnothing of \"casual-connection,\" of \"necessity,\" or of \"psychological\nnon-freedom\"; there the effect does NOT follow the cause, there \"law\"\ndoes not obtain. It is WE alone who have devised cause, sequence,\nreciprocity, relativity, constraint, number, law, freedom, motive,\nand purpose; and when we interpret and intermix this symbol-world,\nas \"being-in-itself,\" with things, we act once more as we have always\nacted--MYTHOLOGICALLY. The \"non-free will\" is mythology; in real life\nit is only a question of STRONG and WEAK wills.--It is almost always\na symptom of what is lacking in himself, when a thinker, in every\n\"causal-connection\" and \"psychological necessity,\" manifests something\nof compulsion, indigence, obsequiousness, oppression, and non-freedom;\nit is suspicious to have such feelings--the person betrays himself. And\nin general, if I have observed correctly, the \"non-freedom of the will\"\nis regarded as a problem from two entirely opposite standpoints, but\nalways in a profoundly PERSONAL manner: some will not give up their\n\"responsibility,\" their belief in THEMSELVES, the personal right to\nTHEIR merits, at any price (the vain races belong to this class); others\non the contrary, do not wish to be answerable for anything, or blamed\nfor anything, and owing to an inward self-contempt, seek to GET OUT OF\nTHE BUSINESS, no matter how. The latter, when they write books, are\nin the habit at present of taking the side of criminals; a sort of\nsocialistic sympathy is their favourite disguise.

Whoever, in\nintercourse with men, does not occasionally glisten in all the green\nand grey colours of distress, owing to disgust, satiety, sympathy,\ngloominess, and solitariness, is assuredly not a man of elevated tastes;\nsupposing, however, that he does not voluntarily take all this burden\nand disgust upon himself, that he persistently avoids it, and remains,\nas I said, quietly and proudly hidden in his citadel, one thing is then\ncertain: he was not made, he was not predestined for knowledge.

Throughout the longest period of human history--one calls it the\nprehistoric period--the value or non-value of an action was inferred\nfrom its CONSEQUENCES; the action in itself was not taken into\nconsideration, any more than its origin; but pretty much as in China at\npresent, where the distinction or disgrace of a child redounds to\nits parents, the retro-operating power of success or failure was what\ninduced men to think well or ill of an action. Let us call this period\nthe PRE-MORAL period of mankind; the imperative, \"Know thyself!\" was\nthen still unknown.--In the last ten thousand years, on the other hand,\non certain large portions of the earth, one has gradually got so far,\nthat one no longer lets the consequences of an action, but its origin,\ndecide with regard to its worth: a great achievement as a whole, an\nimportant refinement of vision and of criterion, the unconscious effect\nof the supremacy of aristocratic values and of the belief in \"origin,\"\nthe mark of a period which may be designated in the narrower sense as\nthe MORAL one: the first attempt at self-knowledge is thereby\nmade. Instead of the consequences, the origin--what an inversion\nof perspective! And assuredly an inversion effected only after long\nstruggle and wavering! To be sure, an ominous new superstition, a\npeculiar narrowness of interpretation, attained supremacy precisely\nthereby: the origin of an action was interpreted in the most definite\nsense possible, as origin out of an INTENTION; people were agreed in the\nbelief that the value of an action lay in the value of its intention.\nThe intention as the sole origin and antecedent history of an action:\nunder the influence of this prejudice moral praise and blame have been\nbestowed, and men have judged and even philosophized almost up to the\npresent day.--Is it not possible, however, that the necessity may now\nhave arisen of again making up our minds with regard to the reversing\nand fundamental shifting of values, owing to a new self-consciousness\nand acuteness in man--is it not possible that we may be standing on\nthe threshold of a period which to begin with, would be distinguished\nnegatively as ULTRA-MORAL: nowadays when, at least among us immoralists,\nthe suspicion arises that the decisive value of an action lies precisely\nin that which is NOT INTENTIONAL, and that all its intentionalness, all\nthat is seen, sensible, or \"sensed\" in it, belongs to its surface or\nskin--which, like every skin, betrays something, but CONCEALS still\nmore? In short, we believe that the intention is only a sign or symptom,\nwhich first requires an explanation--a sign, moreover, which has too\nmany interpretations, and consequently hardly any meaning in itself\nalone: that morality, in the sense in which it has been understood\nhitherto, as intention-morality, has been a prejudice, perhaps a\nprematureness or preliminariness, probably something of the same rank\nas astrology and alchemy, but in any case something which must be\nsurmounted. The surmounting of morality, in a certain sense even the\nself-mounting of morality--let that be the name for the long-secret\nlabour which has been reserved for the most refined, the most upright,\nand also the most wicked consciences of today, as the living touchstones\nof the soul.\n"}

In all\nseriousness, the innocence of thinkers has something touching and\nrespect-inspiring in it, which even nowadays permits them to wait upon\nconsciousness with the request that it will give them HONEST answers:\nfor example, whether it be \"real\" or not, and why it keeps the outer\nworld so resolutely at a distance, and other questions of the same\ndescription.

In addition to this, the\ncontemplation of the saint suggested to them a suspicion: such an\nenormity of self-negation and anti-naturalness will not have been\ncoveted for nothing--they have said, inquiringly. There is perhaps a\nreason for it, some very great danger, about which the ascetic might\nwish to be more accurately informed through his secret interlocutors and\nvisitors?

Modern philosophy,\nas epistemological skepticism, is secretly or openly ANTI-CHRISTIAN,\nalthough (for keener ears, be it said) by no means anti-religious.\nFormerly, in effect, one believed in \"the soul\" as one believed in\ngrammar and the grammatical subject: one said, \"I\" is the condition,\n\"think\" is the predicate and is conditioned--to think is an activity for\nwhich one MUST suppose a subject as cause. The attempt was then made,\nwith marvelous tenacity and subtlety, to see if one could not get out\nof this net,--to see if the opposite was not perhaps true: \"think\" the\ncondition, and \"I\" the conditioned; \"I,\" therefore, only a synthesis\nwhich has been MADE by thinking itself.

Then, during the moral epoch of mankind, they sacrificed\nto their God the strongest instincts they possessed, their \"nature\";\nTHIS festal joy shines in the cruel glances of ascetics and\n\"anti-natural\" fanatics. Finally, what still remained to be sacrificed?\nWas it not necessary in the end for men to sacrifice everything\ncomforting, holy, healing, all hope, all faith in hidden harmonies, in\nfuture blessedness and justice?

{"body": "58. Has it been observed to what extent outward idleness, or\nsemi-idleness, is necessary to a real religious life (alike for its\nfavourite microscopic labour of self-examination, and for its soft\nplacidity called \"prayer,\" the state of perpetual readiness for the\n\"coming of God\"), I mean the idleness with a good conscience, the\nidleness of olden times and of blood, to which the aristocratic\nsentiment that work is DISHONOURING--that it vulgarizes body and\nsoul--is not quite unfamiliar? And that consequently the modern, noisy,\ntime-engrossing, conceited, foolishly proud laboriousness educates\nand prepares for \"unbelief\" more than anything else? Among these, for\ninstance, who are at present living apart from religion in Germany, I\nfind \"free-thinkers\" of diversified species and origin, but above all\na majority of those in whom laboriousness from generation to generation\nhas dissolved the religious instincts; so that they no longer know what\npurpose religions serve, and only note their existence in the world\nwith a kind of dull astonishment. They feel themselves already fully\noccupied, these good people, be it by their business or by their\npleasures, not to mention the \"Fatherland,\" and the newspapers, and\ntheir \"family duties\"; it seems that they have no time whatever left\nfor religion; and above all, it is not obvious to them whether it is a\nquestion of a new business or a new pleasure--for it is impossible, they\nsay to themselves, that people should go to church merely to spoil\ntheir tempers. They are by no means enemies of religious customs;\nshould certain circumstances, State affairs perhaps, require their\nparticipation in such customs, they do what is required, as so many\nthings are done--with a patient and unassuming seriousness, and without\nmuch curiosity or discomfort;--they live too much apart and outside\nto feel even the necessity for a FOR or AGAINST in such matters. Among\nthose indifferent persons may be reckoned nowadays the majority of\nGerman Protestants of the middle classes, especially in the great\nlaborious centres of trade and commerce; also the majority of laborious\nscholars, and the entire University personnel (with the exception of\nthe theologians, whose existence and possibility there always gives\npsychologists new and more subtle puzzles to solve). On the part of\npious, or merely church-going people, there is seldom any idea of HOW\nMUCH good-will, one might say arbitrary will, is now necessary for a\nGerman scholar to take the problem of religion seriously; his whole\nprofession (and as I have said, his whole workmanlike laboriousness, to\nwhich he is compelled by his modern conscience) inclines him to a\nlofty and almost charitable serenity as regards religion, with which is\noccasionally mingled a slight disdain for the \"uncleanliness\" of spirit\nwhich he takes for granted wherever any one still professes to belong\nto the Church. It is only with the help of history (NOT through his own\npersonal experience, therefore) that the scholar succeeds in bringing\nhimself to a respectful seriousness, and to a certain timid deference\nin presence of religions; but even when his sentiments have reached the\nstage of gratitude towards them, he has not personally advanced one\nstep nearer to that which still maintains itself as Church or as piety;\nperhaps even the contrary. The practical indifference to religious\nmatters in the midst of which he has been born and brought up, usually\nsublimates itself in his case into circumspection and cleanliness, which\nshuns contact with religious men and things; and it may be just the\ndepth of his tolerance and humanity which prompts him to avoid the\ndelicate trouble which tolerance itself brings with it.--Every age has\nits own divine type of naivete, for the discovery of which other ages\nmay envy it: and how much naivete--adorable, childlike, and boundlessly\nfoolish naivete is involved in this belief of the scholar in\nhis superiority, in the good conscience of his tolerance, in the\nunsuspecting, simple certainty with which his instinct treats the\nreligious man as a lower and less valuable type, beyond, before, and\nABOVE which he himself has developed--he, the little arrogant dwarf\nand mob-man, the sedulously alert, head-and-hand drudge of \"ideas,\" of\n\"modern ideas\"!\n"}

It is the profound, suspicious fear of an incurable\npessimism which compels whole centuries to fasten their teeth into a\nreligious interpretation of existence: the fear of the instinct which\ndivines that truth might be attained TOO soon, before man has become\nstrong enough, hard enough, artist enough.... Piety, the \"Life in God,\"\nregarded in this light, would appear as the most elaborate and\nultimate product of the FEAR of truth, as artist-adoration\nand artist-intoxication in presence of the most logical of all\nfalsifications, as the will to the inversion of truth, to untruth at\nany price.

The philosopher, as WE free spirits understand him--as the man of\nthe greatest responsibility, who has the conscience for the general\ndevelopment of mankind,--will use religion for his disciplining and\neducating work, just as he will use the contemporary political\nand economic conditions. The selecting and disciplining\ninfluence--destructive, as well as creative and fashioning--which can be\nexercised by means of religion is manifold and varied, according to the\nsort of people placed under its spell and protection. For those who are\nstrong and independent, destined and trained to command, in whom the\njudgment and skill of a ruling race is incorporated, religion is\nan additional means for overcoming resistance in the exercise of\nauthority--as a bond which binds rulers and subjects in common,\nbetraying and surrendering to the former the conscience of the latter,\ntheir inmost heart, which would fain escape obedience. And in the\ncase of the unique natures of noble origin, if by virtue of superior\nspirituality they should incline to a more retired and contemplative\nlife, reserving to themselves only the more refined forms of government\n(over chosen disciples or members of an order), religion itself may\nbe used as a means for obtaining peace from the noise and trouble of\nmanaging GROSSER affairs, and for securing immunity from the UNAVOIDABLE\nfilth of all political agitation. The Brahmins, for instance, understood\nthis fact. With the help of a religious organization, they secured to\nthemselves the power of nominating kings for the people, while their\nsentiments prompted them to keep apart and outside, as men with a higher\nand super-regal mission. At the same time religion gives inducement and\nopportunity to some of the subjects to qualify themselves for future\nruling and commanding the slowly ascending ranks and classes, in which,\nthrough fortunate marriage customs, volitional power and delight in\nself-control are on the increase. To them religion offers sufficient\nincentives and temptations to aspire to higher intellectuality, and to\nexperience the sentiments of authoritative self-control, of silence, and\nof solitude. Asceticism and Puritanism are almost indispensable means of\neducating and ennobling a race which seeks to rise above its hereditary\nbaseness and work itself upwards to future supremacy. And finally, to\nordinary men, to the majority of the people, who exist for service and\ngeneral utility, and are only so far entitled to exist, religion gives\ninvaluable contentedness with their lot and condition, peace of heart,\nennoblement of obedience, additional social happiness and sympathy,\nwith something of transfiguration and embellishment, something of\njustification of all the commonplaceness, all the meanness, all\nthe semi-animal poverty of their souls. Religion, together with the\nreligious significance of life, sheds sunshine over such perpetually\nharassed men, and makes even their own aspect endurable to them, it\noperates upon them as the Epicurean philosophy usually operates upon\nsufferers of a higher order, in a refreshing and refining manner,\nalmost TURNING suffering TO ACCOUNT, and in the end even hallowing and\nvindicating it. There is perhaps nothing so admirable in Christianity\nand Buddhism as their art of teaching even the lowest to elevate\nthemselves by piety to a seemingly higher order of things, and thereby\nto retain their satisfaction with the actual world in which they find it\ndifficult enough to live--this very difficulty being necessary.\n"}
{"body": "62. To be sure--to make also the bad counter-reckoning against such\nreligions, and to bring to light their secret dangers--the cost is\nalways excessive and terrible when religions do NOT operate as an\neducational and disciplinary medium in the hands of the philosopher, but\nrule voluntarily and PARAMOUNTLY, when they wish to be the final end,\nand not a means along with other means. Among men, as among all other\nanimals, there is a surplus of defective, diseased, degenerating,\ninfirm, and necessarily suffering individuals; the successful cases,\namong men also, are always the exception; and in view of the fact that\nman is THE ANIMAL NOT YET PROPERLY ADAPTED TO HIS ENVIRONMENT, the rare\nexception. But worse still. The higher the type a man represents, the\ngreater is the improbability that he will SUCCEED; the accidental, the\nlaw of irrationality in the general constitution of mankind, manifests\nitself most terribly in its destructive effect on the higher orders of\nmen, the conditions of whose lives are delicate, diverse, and difficult\nto determine. What, then, is the attitude of the two greatest religions\nabove-mentioned to the SURPLUS of failures in life? They endeavour\nto preserve and keep alive whatever can be preserved; in fact, as the\nreligions FOR SUFFERERS, they take the part of these upon principle;\nthey are always in favour of those who suffer from life as from a\ndisease, and they would fain treat every other experience of life as\nfalse and impossible. However highly we may esteem this indulgent and\npreservative care (inasmuch as in applying to others, it has applied,\nand applies also to the highest and usually the most suffering type of\nman), the hitherto PARAMOUNT religions--to give a general appreciation\nof them--are among the principal causes which have kept the type of\n\"man\" upon a lower level--they have preserved too much THAT WHICH SHOULD\nHAVE PERISHED. One has to thank them for invaluable services; and who is\nsufficiently rich in gratitude not to feel poor at the contemplation\nof all that the \"spiritual men\" of Christianity have done for Europe\nhitherto! But when they had given comfort to the sufferers, courage to\nthe oppressed and despairing, a staff and support to the helpless,\nand when they had allured from society into convents and spiritual\npenitentiaries the broken-hearted and distracted: what else had they\nto do in order to work systematically in that fashion, and with a good\nconscience, for the preservation of all the sick and suffering, which\nmeans, in deed and in truth, to work for the DETERIORATION OF THE\nEUROPEAN RACE? To REVERSE all estimates of value--THAT is what they\nhad to do! And to shatter the strong, to spoil great hopes, to cast\nsuspicion on the delight in beauty, to break down everything autonomous,\nmanly, conquering, and imperious--all instincts which are natural to the\nhighest and most successful type of \"man\"--into uncertainty, distress\nof conscience, and self-destruction; forsooth, to invert all love of the\nearthly and of supremacy over the earth, into hatred of the earth and\nearthly things--THAT is the task the Church imposed on itself, and\nwas obliged to impose, until, according to its standard of value,\n\"unworldliness,\" \"unsensuousness,\" and \"higher man\" fused into one\nsentiment. If one could observe the strangely painful, equally coarse\nand refined comedy of European Christianity with the derisive and\nimpartial eye of an Epicurean god, I should think one would never cease\nmarvelling and laughing; does it not actually seem that some single will\nhas ruled over Europe for eighteen centuries in order to make a SUBLIME\nABORTION of man? He, however, who, with opposite requirements (no longer\nEpicurean) and with some divine hammer in his hand, could approach this\nalmost voluntary degeneration and stunting of mankind, as exemplified in\nthe European Christian (Pascal, for instance), would he not have to\ncry aloud with rage, pity, and horror: \"Oh, you bunglers, presumptuous\npitiful bunglers, what have you done! Was that a work for your hands?\nHow you have hacked and botched my finest stone! What have you presumed\nto do!\"--I should say that Christianity has hitherto been the most\nportentous of presumptions. Men, not great enough, nor hard enough,\nto be entitled as artists to take part in fashioning MAN; men,\nnot sufficiently strong and far-sighted to ALLOW, with sublime\nself-constraint, the obvious law of the thousandfold failures and\nperishings to prevail; men, not sufficiently noble to see the radically\ndifferent grades of rank and intervals of rank that separate man from\nman:--SUCH men, with their \"equality before God,\" have hitherto swayed\nthe destiny of Europe; until at last a dwarfed, almost ludicrous species\nhas been produced, a gregarious animal, something obliging, sickly,\nmediocre, the European of the present day.\n"}

{"body": "CHAPTER V. THE NATURAL HISTORY OF MORALS\n"}
{"body": "186. The moral sentiment in Europe at present is perhaps as subtle,\nbelated, diverse, sensitive, and refined, as the \"Science of Morals\"\nbelonging thereto is recent, initial, awkward, and coarse-fingered:--an\ninteresting contrast, which sometimes becomes incarnate and obvious\nin the very person of a moralist. Indeed, the expression, \"Science\nof Morals\" is, in respect to what is designated thereby, far too\npresumptuous and counter to GOOD taste,--which is always a foretaste of\nmore modest expressions. One ought to avow with the utmost fairness WHAT\nis still necessary here for a long time, WHAT is alone proper for the\npresent: namely, the collection of material, the comprehensive survey\nand classification of an immense domain of delicate sentiments of worth,\nand distinctions of worth, which live, grow, propagate, and perish--and\nperhaps attempts to give a clear idea of the recurring and more common\nforms of these living crystallizations--as preparation for a THEORY OF\nTYPES of morality. To be sure, people have not hitherto been so modest.\nAll the philosophers, with a pedantic and ridiculous seriousness,\ndemanded of themselves something very much higher, more pretentious, and\nceremonious, when they concerned themselves with morality as a science:\nthey wanted to GIVE A BASIC to morality--and every philosopher hitherto\nhas believed that he has given it a basis; morality itself, however, has\nbeen regarded as something \"given.\" How far from their awkward pride\nwas the seemingly insignificant problem--left in dust and decay--of a\ndescription of forms of morality, notwithstanding that the finest hands\nand senses could hardly be fine enough for it! It was precisely owing to\nmoral philosophers' knowing the moral facts imperfectly, in an arbitrary\nepitome, or an accidental abridgement--perhaps as the morality of\ntheir environment, their position, their church, their Zeitgeist, their\nclimate and zone--it was precisely because they were badly instructed\nwith regard to nations, eras, and past ages, and were by no means eager\nto know about these matters, that they did not even come in sight of the\nreal problems of morals--problems which only disclose themselves by\na comparison of MANY kinds of morality. In every \"Science of Morals\"\nhitherto, strange as it may sound, the problem of morality itself\nhas been OMITTED: there has been no suspicion that there was anything\nproblematic there! That which philosophers called \"giving a basis to\nmorality,\" and endeavoured to realize, has, when seen in a right light,\nproved merely a learned form of good FAITH in prevailing morality, a new\nmeans of its EXPRESSION, consequently just a matter-of-fact within the\nsphere of a definite morality, yea, in its ultimate motive, a sort of\ndenial that it is LAWFUL for this morality to be called in question--and\nin any case the reverse of the testing, analyzing, doubting, and\nvivisecting of this very faith. Hear, for instance, with what\ninnocence--almost worthy of honour--Schopenhauer represents his own\ntask, and draw your conclusions concerning the scientificness of a\n\"Science\" whose latest master still talks in the strain of children and\nold wives: \"The principle,\" he says (page 136 of the Grundprobleme der\nEthik), [Footnote: Pages 54-55 of Schopenhauer's Basis of Morality,\ntranslated by Arthur B. Bullock, M.A. (1903).] \"the axiom about the\npurport of which all moralists are PRACTICALLY agreed: neminem laede,\nimmo omnes quantum potes juva--is REALLY the proposition which all moral\nteachers strive to establish, ... the REAL basis of ethics which\nhas been sought, like the philosopher's stone, for centuries.\"--The\ndifficulty of establishing the proposition referred to may indeed be\ngreat--it is well known that Schopenhauer also was unsuccessful in his\nefforts; and whoever has thoroughly realized how absurdly false and\nsentimental this proposition is, in a world whose essence is Will\nto Power, may be reminded that Schopenhauer, although a pessimist,\nACTUALLY--played the flute... daily after dinner: one may read about\nthe matter in his biography. A question by the way: a pessimist, a\nrepudiator of God and of the world, who MAKES A HALT at morality--who\nassents to morality, and plays the flute to laede-neminem morals, what?\nIs that really--a pessimist?\n"}
{"body": "187. Apart from the value of such assertions as \"there is a categorical\nimperative in us,\" one can always ask: What does such an assertion\nindicate about him who makes it? There are systems of morals which are\nmeant to justify their author in the eyes of other people; other systems\nof morals are meant to tranquilize him, and make him self-satisfied;\nwith other systems he wants to crucify and humble himself, with others\nhe wishes to take revenge, with others to conceal himself, with others\nto glorify himself and gave superiority and distinction,--this system of\nmorals helps its author to forget, that system makes him, or something\nof him, forgotten, many a moralist would like to exercise power and\ncreative arbitrariness over mankind, many another, perhaps, Kant\nespecially, gives us to understand by his morals that \"what is estimable\nin me, is that I know how to obey--and with you it SHALL not be\notherwise than with me!\" In short, systems of morals are only a\nSIGN-LANGUAGE OF THE EMOTIONS.\n"}
{"body": "188. In contrast to laisser-aller, every system of morals is a sort of\ntyranny against \"nature\" and also against \"reason\", that is, however, no\nobjection, unless one should again decree by some system of morals, that\nall kinds of tyranny and unreasonableness are unlawful What is\nessential and invaluable in every system of morals, is that it is a\nlong constraint. In order to understand Stoicism, or Port Royal,\nor Puritanism, one should remember the constraint under which every\nlanguage has attained to strength and freedom--the metrical constraint,\nthe tyranny of rhyme and rhythm. How much trouble have the poets and\norators of every nation given themselves!--not excepting some of\nthe prose writers of today, in whose ear dwells an inexorable\nconscientiousness--\"for the sake of a folly,\" as utilitarian bunglers\nsay, and thereby deem themselves wise--\"from submission to arbitrary\nlaws,\" as the anarchists say, and thereby fancy themselves \"free,\" even\nfree-spirited. The singular fact remains, however, that everything\nof the nature of freedom, elegance, boldness, dance, and masterly\ncertainty, which exists or has existed, whether it be in thought itself,\nor in administration, or in speaking and persuading, in art just as in\nconduct, has only developed by means of the tyranny of such arbitrary\nlaw, and in all seriousness, it is not at all improbable that precisely\nthis is \"nature\" and \"natural\"--and not laisser-aller! Every artist\nknows how different from the state of letting himself go, is his\n\"most natural\" condition, the free arranging, locating, disposing,\nand constructing in the moments of \"inspiration\"--and how strictly and\ndelicately he then obeys a thousand laws, which, by their very rigidness\nand precision, defy all formulation by means of ideas (even the most\nstable idea has, in comparison therewith, something floating, manifold,\nand ambiguous in it). The essential thing \"in heaven and in earth\" is,\napparently (to repeat it once more), that there should be long OBEDIENCE\nin the same direction, there thereby results, and has always resulted in\nthe long run, something which has made life worth living; for instance,\nvirtue, art, music, dancing, reason, spirituality--anything whatever\nthat is transfiguring, refined, foolish, or divine. The long bondage of\nthe spirit, the distrustful constraint in the communicability of\nideas, the discipline which the thinker imposed on himself to think\nin accordance with the rules of a church or a court, or conformable\nto Aristotelian premises, the persistent spiritual will to interpret\neverything that happened according to a Christian scheme, and in every\noccurrence to rediscover and justify the Christian God:--all this\nviolence, arbitrariness, severity, dreadfulness, and unreasonableness,\nhas proved itself the disciplinary means whereby the European spirit has\nattained its strength, its remorseless curiosity and subtle mobility;\ngranted also that much irrecoverable strength and spirit had to be\nstifled, suffocated, and spoilt in the process (for here, as everywhere,\n\"nature\" shows herself as she is, in all her extravagant and INDIFFERENT\nmagnificence, which is shocking, but nevertheless noble). That\nfor centuries European thinkers only thought in order to prove\nsomething--nowadays, on the contrary, we are suspicious of every thinker\nwho \"wishes to prove something\"--that it was always settled beforehand\nwhat WAS TO BE the result of their strictest thinking, as it was perhaps\nin the Asiatic astrology of former times, or as it is still at the\npresent day in the innocent, Christian-moral explanation of immediate\npersonal events \"for the glory of God,\" or \"for the good of the\nsoul\":--this tyranny, this arbitrariness, this severe and magnificent\nstupidity, has EDUCATED the spirit; slavery, both in the coarser and\nthe finer sense, is apparently an indispensable means even of spiritual\neducation and discipline. One may look at every system of morals in this\nlight: it is \"nature\" therein which teaches to hate the laisser-aller,\nthe too great freedom, and implants the need for limited horizons, for\nimmediate duties--it teaches the NARROWING OF PERSPECTIVES, and thus, in\na certain sense, that stupidity is a condition of life and development.\n\"Thou must obey some one, and for a long time; OTHERWISE thou wilt come\nto grief, and lose all respect for thyself\"--this seems to me to be the\nmoral imperative of nature, which is certainly neither \"categorical,\"\nas old Kant wished (consequently the \"otherwise\"), nor does it address\nitself to the individual (what does nature care for the individual!),\nbut to nations, races, ages, and ranks; above all, however, to the\nanimal \"man\" generally, to MANKIND.\n"}
{"body": "189. Industrious races find it a great hardship to be idle: it was a\nmaster stroke of ENGLISH instinct to hallow and begloom Sunday to such\nan extent that the Englishman unconsciously hankers for his week--and\nwork-day again:--as a kind of cleverly devised, cleverly intercalated\nFAST, such as is also frequently found in the ancient world (although,\nas is appropriate in southern nations, not precisely with respect\nto work). Many kinds of fasts are necessary; and wherever powerful\ninfluences and habits prevail, legislators have to see that intercalary\ndays are appointed, on which such impulses are fettered, and learn to\nhunger anew. Viewed from a higher standpoint, whole generations and\nepochs, when they show themselves infected with any moral fanaticism,\nseem like those intercalated periods of restraint and fasting, during\nwhich an impulse learns to humble and submit itself--at the same time\nalso to PURIFY and SHARPEN itself; certain philosophical sects likewise\nadmit of a similar interpretation (for instance, the Stoa, in the midst\nof Hellenic culture, with the atmosphere rank and overcharged with\nAphrodisiacal odours).--Here also is a hint for the explanation of the\nparadox, why it was precisely in the most Christian period of European\nhistory, and in general only under the pressure of Christian sentiments,\nthat the sexual impulse sublimated into love (amour-passion).\n"}
{"body": "190. There is something in the morality of Plato which does not really\nbelong to Plato, but which only appears in his philosophy, one might\nsay, in spite of him: namely, Socratism, for which he himself was\ntoo noble. \"No one desires to injure himself, hence all evil is done\nunwittingly. The evil man inflicts injury on himself; he would not do\nso, however, if he knew that evil is evil. The evil man, therefore, is\nonly evil through error; if one free him from error one will necessarily\nmake him--good.\"--This mode of reasoning savours of the POPULACE, who\nperceive only the unpleasant consequences of evil-doing, and practically\njudge that \"it is STUPID to do wrong\"; while they accept \"good\" as\nidentical with \"useful and pleasant,\" without further thought. As\nregards every system of utilitarianism, one may at once assume that it\nhas the same origin, and follow the scent: one will seldom err.--Plato\ndid all he could to interpret something refined and noble into the\ntenets of his teacher, and above all to interpret himself into them--he,\nthe most daring of all interpreters, who lifted the entire Socrates out\nof the street, as a popular theme and song, to exhibit him in endless\nand impossible modifications--namely, in all his own disguises and\nmultiplicities. In jest, and in Homeric language as well, what is the\nPlatonic Socrates, if not--[Greek words inserted here.]\n"}
{"body": "191. The old theological problem of \"Faith\" and \"Knowledge,\" or more\nplainly, of instinct and reason--the question whether, in respect to the\nvaluation of things, instinct deserves more authority than rationality,\nwhich wants to appreciate and act according to motives, according to\na \"Why,\" that is to say, in conformity to purpose and utility--it\nis always the old moral problem that first appeared in the person of\nSocrates, and had divided men's minds long before Christianity. Socrates\nhimself, following, of course, the taste of his talent--that of a\nsurpassing dialectician--took first the side of reason; and, in fact,\nwhat did he do all his life but laugh at the awkward incapacity of the\nnoble Athenians, who were men of instinct, like all noble men, and could\nnever give satisfactory answers concerning the motives of their actions?\nIn the end, however, though silently and secretly, he laughed also\nat himself: with his finer conscience and introspection, he found\nin himself the same difficulty and incapacity. \"But why\"--he said\nto himself--\"should one on that account separate oneself from the\ninstincts! One must set them right, and the reason ALSO--one must follow\nthe instincts, but at the same time persuade the reason to support them\nwith good arguments.\" This was the real FALSENESS of that great and\nmysterious ironist; he brought his conscience up to the point that he\nwas satisfied with a kind of self-outwitting: in fact, he perceived\nthe irrationality in the moral judgment.--Plato, more innocent in such\nmatters, and without the craftiness of the plebeian, wished to prove to\nhimself, at the expenditure of all his strength--the greatest strength\na philosopher had ever expended--that reason and instinct lead\nspontaneously to one goal, to the good, to \"God\"; and since Plato, all\ntheologians and philosophers have followed the same path--which means\nthat in matters of morality, instinct (or as Christians call it,\n\"Faith,\" or as I call it, \"the herd\") has hitherto triumphed. Unless\none should make an exception in the case of Descartes, the father of\nrationalism (and consequently the grandfather of the Revolution), who\nrecognized only the authority of reason: but reason is only a tool, and\nDescartes was superficial.\n"}
{"body": "192. Whoever has followed the history of a single science, finds in\nits development a clue to the understanding of the oldest and commonest\nprocesses of all \"knowledge and cognizance\": there, as here, the\npremature hypotheses, the fictions, the good stupid will to \"belief,\"\nand the lack of distrust and patience are first developed--our senses\nlearn late, and never learn completely, to be subtle, reliable, and\ncautious organs of knowledge. Our eyes find it easier on a given\noccasion to produce a picture already often produced, than to seize upon\nthe divergence and novelty of an impression: the latter requires more\nforce, more \"morality.\" It is difficult and painful for the ear to\nlisten to anything new; we hear strange music badly. When we hear\nanother language spoken, we involuntarily attempt to form the sounds\ninto words with which we are more familiar and conversant--it was thus,\nfor example, that the Germans modified the spoken word ARCUBALISTA into\nARMBRUST (cross-bow). Our senses are also hostile and averse to the\nnew; and generally, even in the \"simplest\" processes of sensation, the\nemotions DOMINATE--such as fear, love, hatred, and the passive emotion\nof indolence.--As little as a reader nowadays reads all the single words\n(not to speak of syllables) of a page--he rather takes about five out\nof every twenty words at random, and \"guesses\" the probably appropriate\nsense to them--just as little do we see a tree correctly and completely\nin respect to its leaves, branches, colour, and shape; we find it so\nmuch easier to fancy the chance of a tree. Even in the midst of the\nmost remarkable experiences, we still do just the same; we fabricate the\ngreater part of the experience, and can hardly be made to contemplate\nany event, EXCEPT as \"inventors\" thereof. All this goes to prove\nthat from our fundamental nature and from remote ages we have\nbeen--ACCUSTOMED TO LYING. Or, to express it more politely and\nhypocritically, in short, more pleasantly--one is much more of an artist\nthan one is aware of.--In an animated conversation, I often see the face\nof the person with whom I am speaking so clearly and sharply defined\nbefore me, according to the thought he expresses, or which I believe to\nbe evoked in his mind, that the degree of distinctness far exceeds the\nSTRENGTH of my visual faculty--the delicacy of the play of the muscles\nand of the expression of the eyes MUST therefore be imagined by me.\nProbably the person put on quite a different expression, or none at all.\n"}

As regards a woman,\nfor instance, the control over her body and her sexual gratification\nserves as an amply sufficient sign of ownership and possession to the\nmore modest man; another with a more suspicious and ambitious thirst for\npossession, sees the \"questionableness,\" the mere apparentness of such\nownership, and wishes to have finer tests in order to know especially\nwhether the woman not only gives herself to him, but also gives up for\nhis sake what she has or would like to have--only THEN does he look upon\nher as \"possessed.\" A third, however, has not even here got to the limit\nof his distrust and his desire for possession: he asks himself whether\nthe woman, when she gives up everything for him, does not perhaps do\nso for a phantom of him; he wishes first to be thoroughly, indeed,\nprofoundly well known; in order to be loved at all he ventures to let\nhimself be found out. Only then does he feel the beloved one fully in\nhis possession, when she no longer deceives herself about him, when\nshe loves him just as much for the sake of his devilry and concealed\ninsatiability, as for his goodness, patience, and spirituality. One\nman would like to possess a nation, and he finds all the higher arts of\nCagliostro and Catalina suitable for his purpose. Another, with a more\nrefined thirst for possession, says to himself: \"One may not deceive\nwhere one desires to possess\"--he is irritated and impatient at the idea\nthat a mask of him should rule in the hearts of the people: \"I must,\ntherefore, MAKE myself known, and first of all learn to know myself!\"\nAmong helpful and charitable people, one almost always finds the awkward\ncraftiness which first gets up suitably him who has to be helped, as\nthough, for instance, he should \"merit\" help, seek just THEIR help, and\nwould show himself deeply grateful, attached, and subservient to them\nfor all help. With these conceits, they take control of the needy as a\nproperty, just as in general they are charitable and helpful out of a\ndesire for property. One finds them jealous when they are crossed or\nforestalled in their charity. Parents involuntarily make something like\nthemselves out of their children--they call that \"education\"; no mother\ndoubts at the bottom of her heart that the child she has borne is\nthereby her property, no father hesitates about his right to HIS OWN\nideas and notions of worth. Indeed, in former times fathers deemed it\nright to use their discretion concerning the life or death of the newly\nborn (as among the ancient Germans). And like the father, so also do the\nteacher, the class, the priest, and the prince still see in every new\nindividual an unobjectionable opportunity for a new possession. The\nconsequence is...\n"}

Inasmuch as in all ages, as long as mankind has existed, there have\nalso been human herds (family alliances, communities, tribes, peoples,\nstates, churches), and always a great number who obey in proportion\nto the small number who command--in view, therefore, of the fact that\nobedience has been most practiced and fostered among mankind hitherto,\none may reasonably suppose that, generally speaking, the need thereof is\nnow innate in every one, as a kind of FORMAL CONSCIENCE which gives\nthe command \"Thou shalt unconditionally do something, unconditionally\nrefrain from something\", in short, \"Thou shalt\". This need tries to\nsatisfy itself and to fill its form with a content, according to its\nstrength, impatience, and eagerness, it at once seizes as an omnivorous\nappetite with little selection, and accepts whatever is shouted into\nits ear by all sorts of commanders--parents, teachers, laws, class\nprejudices, or public opinion. The extraordinary limitation of human\ndevelopment, the hesitation, protractedness, frequent retrogression, and\nturning thereof, is attributable to the fact that the herd-instinct of\nobedience is transmitted best, and at the cost of the art of command. If\none imagine this instinct increasing to its greatest extent, commanders\nand independent individuals will finally be lacking altogether, or they\nwill suffer inwardly from a bad conscience, and will have to impose\na deception on themselves in the first place in order to be able to\ncommand just as if they also were only obeying. This condition of things\nactually exists in Europe at present--I call it the moral hypocrisy of\nthe commanding class.

On the other hand, the\ngregarious European man nowadays assumes an air as if he were the only\nkind of man that is allowable, he glorifies his qualities, such as\npublic spirit, kindness, deference, industry, temperance, modesty,\nindulgence, sympathy, by virtue of which he is gentle, endurable, and\nuseful to the herd, as the peculiarly human virtues.

As long as the utility which determines moral estimates is only\ngregarious utility, as long as the preservation of the community is only\nkept in view, and the immoral is sought precisely and exclusively in\nwhat seems dangerous to the maintenance of the community, there can be\nno \"morality of love to one's neighbour.\" Granted even that there is\nalready a little constant exercise of consideration, sympathy, fairness,\ngentleness, and mutual assistance, granted that even in this condition\nof society all those instincts are already active which are latterly\ndistinguished by honourable names as \"virtues,\" and eventually almost\ncoincide with the conception \"morality\": in that period they do not\nas yet belong to the domain of moral valuations--they are still\nULTRA-MORAL. A sympathetic action, for instance, is neither called good\nnor bad, moral nor immoral, in the best period of the Romans; and should\nit be praised, a sort of resentful disdain is compatible with this\npraise, even at the best, directly the sympathetic action is compared\nwith one which contributes to the welfare of the whole, to the RES\nPUBLICA. After all, \"love to our neighbour\" is always a secondary\nmatter, partly conventional and arbitrarily manifested in relation to\nour FEAR OF OUR NEIGHBOUR. After the fabric of society seems on the\nwhole established and secured against external dangers, it is this\nfear of our neighbour which again creates new perspectives of moral\nvaluation. Certain strong and dangerous instincts, such as the love of\nenterprise, foolhardiness, revengefulness, astuteness, rapacity, and\nlove of power, which up till then had not only to be honoured from the\npoint of view of general utility--under other names, of course, than\nthose here given--but had to be fostered and cultivated (because they\nwere perpetually required in the common danger against the common\nenemies), are now felt in their dangerousness to be doubly strong--when\nthe outlets for them are lacking--and are gradually branded as immoral\nand given over to calumny. The contrary instincts and inclinations now\nattain to moral honour, the gregarious instinct gradually draws its\nconclusions. How much or how little dangerousness to the community or\nto equality is contained in an opinion, a condition, an emotion, a\ndisposition, or an endowment--that is now the moral perspective, here\nagain fear is the mother of morals. It is by the loftiest and strongest\ninstincts, when they break out passionately and carry the individual\nfar above and beyond the average, and the low level of the gregarious\nconscience, that the self-reliance of the community is destroyed, its\nbelief in itself, its backbone, as it were, breaks, consequently these\nvery instincts will be most branded and defamed. The lofty independent\nspirituality, the will to stand alone, and even the cogent reason, are\nfelt to be dangers, everything that elevates the individual above the\nherd, and is a source of fear to the neighbour, is henceforth called\nEVIL, the tolerant, unassuming, self-adapting, self-equalizing\ndisposition, the MEDIOCRITY of desires, attains to moral distinction and\nhonour. Finally, under very peaceful circumstances, there is always\nless opportunity and necessity for training the feelings to severity\nand rigour, and now every form of severity, even in justice, begins\nto disturb the conscience, a lofty and rigorous nobleness and\nself-responsibility almost offends, and awakens distrust, \"the lamb,\"\nand still more \"the sheep,\" wins respect. There is a point of diseased\nmellowness and effeminacy in the history of society, at which society\nitself takes the part of him who injures it, the part of the CRIMINAL,\nand does so, in fact, seriously and honestly. To punish, appears to it\nto be somehow unfair--it is certain that the idea of \"punishment\" and\n\"the obligation to punish\" are then painful and alarming to people. \"Is\nit not sufficient if the criminal be rendered HARMLESS? Why should we\nstill punish? Punishment itself is terrible!\"--with these questions\ngregarious morality, the morality of fear, draws its ultimate\nconclusion. If one could at all do away with danger, the cause of fear,\none would have done away with this morality at the same time, it\nwould no longer be necessary, it WOULD NOT CONSIDER ITSELF any longer\nnecessary!--Whoever examines the conscience of the present-day European,\nwill always elicit the same imperative from its thousand moral folds\nand hidden recesses, the imperative of the timidity of the herd \"we wish\nthat some time or other there may be NOTHING MORE TO FEAR!\" Some time\nor other--the will and the way THERETO is nowadays called \"progress\" all\nover Europe.\n"}
{"body": "202. Let us at once say again what we have already said a hundred\ntimes, for people's ears nowadays are unwilling to hear such truths--OUR\ntruths. We know well enough how offensive it sounds when any one\nplainly, and without metaphor, counts man among the animals, but it will\nbe accounted to us almost a CRIME, that it is precisely in respect to\nmen of \"modern ideas\" that we have constantly applied the terms \"herd,\"\n\"herd-instincts,\" and such like expressions. What avail is it? We cannot\ndo otherwise, for it is precisely here that our new insight is. We\nhave found that in all the principal moral judgments, Europe has become\nunanimous, including likewise the countries where European influence\nprevails in Europe people evidently KNOW what Socrates thought he\ndid not know, and what the famous serpent of old once promised to\nteach--they \"know\" today what is good and evil. It must then sound hard\nand be distasteful to the ear, when we always insist that that which\nhere thinks it knows, that which here glorifies itself with praise\nand blame, and calls itself good, is the instinct of the herding human\nanimal, the instinct which has come and is ever coming more and more\nto the front, to preponderance and supremacy over other instincts,\naccording to the increasing physiological approximation and resemblance\nof which it is the symptom.

Against such a \"possibility,\" against such a \"should\nbe,\" however, this morality defends itself with all its strength, it\nsays obstinately and inexorably \"I am morality itself and nothing else\nis morality!\" Indeed, with the help of a religion which has humoured\nand flattered the sublimest desires of the herding-animal, things have\nreached such a point that we always find a more visible expression of\nthis morality even in political and social arrangements: the DEMOCRATIC\nmovement is the inheritance of the Christian movement. That its TEMPO,\nhowever, is much too slow and sleepy for the more impatient ones, for\nthose who are sick and distracted by the herding-instinct, is indicated\nby the increasingly furious howling, and always less disguised\nteeth-gnashing of the anarchist dogs, who are now roving through the\nhighways of European culture. Apparently in opposition to the peacefully\nindustrious democrats and Revolution-ideologues, and still more so\nto the awkward philosophasters and fraternity-visionaries who call\nthemselves Socialists and want a \"free society,\" those are really at one\nwith them all in their thorough and instinctive hostility to every form\nof society other than that of the AUTONOMOUS herd (to the extent even of\nrepudiating the notions \"master\" and \"servant\"--ni dieu ni maitre, says\na socialist formula); at one in their tenacious opposition to every\nspecial claim, every special right and privilege (this means ultimately\nopposition to EVERY right, for when all are equal, no one needs \"rights\"\nany longer); at one in their distrust of punitive justice (as though it\nwere a violation of the weak, unfair to the NECESSARY consequences of\nall former society); but equally at one in their religion of sympathy,\nin their compassion for all that feels, lives, and suffers (down to the\nvery animals, up even to \"God\"--the extravagance of \"sympathy for\nGod\" belongs to a democratic age); altogether at one in the cry and\nimpatience of their sympathy, in their deadly hatred of suffering\ngenerally, in their almost feminine incapacity for witnessing it or\nALLOWING it; at one in their involuntary beglooming and heart-softening,\nunder the spell of which Europe seems to be threatened with a new\nBuddhism; at one in their belief in the morality of MUTUAL sympathy, as\nthough it were morality in itself, the climax, the ATTAINED climax of\nmankind, the sole hope of the future, the consolation of the present,\nthe great discharge from all the obligations of the past; altogether at\none in their belief in the community as the DELIVERER, in the herd, and\ntherefore in \"themselves.\"\n"}

At the risk that moralizing may also reveal itself here as that\nwhich it has always been--namely, resolutely MONTRER SES PLAIES,\naccording to Balzac--I would venture to protest against an improper and\ninjurious alteration of rank, which quite unnoticed, and as if with the\nbest conscience, threatens nowadays to establish itself in the relations\nof science and philosophy. I mean to say that one must have the right\nout of one's own EXPERIENCE--experience, as it seems to me, always\nimplies unfortunate experience?--to treat of such an important question\nof rank, so as not to speak of colour like the blind, or AGAINST science\nlike women and artists (\"Ah! this dreadful science!\" sigh their instinct\nand their shame, \"it always FINDS THINGS OUT!\"). The declaration of\nindependence of the scientific man, his emancipation from philosophy,\nis one of the subtler after-effects of democratic organization and\ndisorganization: the self-glorification and self-conceitedness of\nthe learned man is now everywhere in full bloom, and in its best\nspringtime--which does not mean to imply that in this case self-praise\nsmells sweet. Here also the instinct of the populace cries, \"Freedom\nfrom all masters!\" and after science has, with the happiest results,\nresisted theology, whose \"hand-maid\" it had been too long, it now\nproposes in its wantonness and indiscretion to lay down laws for\nphilosophy, and in its turn to play the \"master\"--what am I saying!\nto play the PHILOSOPHER on its own account. My memory--the memory of\na scientific man, if you please!--teems with the naivetes of insolence\nwhich I have heard about philosophy and philosophers from young\nnaturalists and old physicians (not to mention the most cultured and\nmost conceited of all learned men, the philologists and schoolmasters,\nwho are both the one and the other by profession). On one occasion it\nwas the specialist and the Jack Horner who instinctively stood on the\ndefensive against all synthetic tasks and capabilities; at another time\nit was the industrious worker who had got a scent of OTIUM and refined\nluxuriousness in the internal economy of the philosopher, and felt\nhimself aggrieved and belittled thereby. On another occasion it was the\ncolour-blindness of the utilitarian, who sees nothing in philosophy but\na series of REFUTED systems, and an extravagant expenditure which \"does\nnobody any good\". At another time the fear of disguised mysticism and of\nthe boundary-adjustment of knowledge became conspicuous, at another\ntime the disregard of individual philosophers, which had involuntarily\nextended to disregard of philosophy generally. In fine, I found most\nfrequently, behind the proud disdain of philosophy in young scholars,\nthe evil after-effect of some particular philosopher, to whom on the\nwhole obedience had been foresworn, without, however, the spell of his\nscornful estimates of other philosophers having been got rid of--the\nresult being a general ill-will to all philosophy. (Such seems to\nme, for instance, the after-effect of Schopenhauer on the most modern\nGermany: by his unintelligent rage against Hegel, he has succeeded in\nsevering the whole of the last generation of Germans from its connection\nwith German culture, which culture, all things considered, has been\nan elevation and a divining refinement of the HISTORICAL SENSE, but\nprecisely at this point Schopenhauer himself was poor, irreceptive,\nand un-German to the extent of ingeniousness.) On the whole, speaking\ngenerally, it may just have been the humanness, all-too-humanness of the\nmodern philosophers themselves, in short, their contemptibleness, which\nhas injured most radically the reverence for philosophy and opened the\ndoors to the instinct of the populace. Let it but be acknowledged to\nwhat an extent our modern world diverges from the whole style of the\nworld of Heraclitus, Plato, Empedocles, and whatever else all the royal\nand magnificent anchorites of the spirit were called, and with what\njustice an honest man of science MAY feel himself of a better family and\norigin, in view of such representatives of philosophy, who, owing to\nthe fashion of the present day, are just as much aloft as they are down\nbelow--in Germany, for instance, the two lions of Berlin, the anarchist\nEugen Duhring and the amalgamist Eduard von Hartmann. It is especially\nthe sight of those hotch-potch philosophers, who call themselves\n\"realists,\" or \"positivists,\" which is calculated to implant a\ndangerous distrust in the soul of a young and ambitious scholar those\nphilosophers, at the best, are themselves but scholars and specialists,\nthat is very evident! All of them are persons who have been vanquished\nand BROUGHT BACK AGAIN under the dominion of science, who at one time\nor another claimed more from themselves, without having a right to the\n\"more\" and its responsibility--and who now, creditably, rancorously, and\nvindictively, represent in word and deed, DISBELIEF in the master-task\nand supremacy of philosophy After all, how could it be otherwise?\nScience flourishes nowadays and has the good conscience clearly visible\non its countenance, while that to which the entire modern philosophy has\ngradually sunk, the remnant of philosophy of the present day, excites\ndistrust and displeasure, if not scorn and pity Philosophy reduced to\na \"theory of knowledge,\" no more in fact than a diffident science of\nepochs and doctrine of forbearance a philosophy that never even\ngets beyond the threshold, and rigorously DENIES itself the right\nto enter--that is philosophy in its last throes, an end, an agony,\nsomething that awakens pity.

Or he gets aloft too late, when the best of his\nmaturity and strength is past, or when he is impaired, coarsened, and\ndeteriorated, so that his view, his general estimate of things, is no\nlonger of much importance. It is perhaps just the refinement of his\nintellectual conscience that makes him hesitate and linger on the\nway, he dreads the temptation to become a dilettante, a millepede, a\nmilleantenna, he knows too well that as a discerner, one who has lost\nhis self-respect no longer commands, no longer LEADS, unless he should\naspire to become a great play-actor, a philosophical Cagliostro and\nspiritual rat-catcher--in short, a misleader. This is in the last\ninstance a question of taste, if it has not really been a question of\nconscience. To double once more the philosopher's difficulties, there is\nalso the fact that he demands from himself a verdict, a Yea or Nay, not\nconcerning science, but concerning life and the worth of life--he learns\nunwillingly to believe that it is his right and even his duty to obtain\nthis verdict, and he has to seek his way to the right and the belief\nonly through the most extensive (perhaps disturbing and destroying)\nexperiences, often hesitating, doubting, and dumbfounded.

Let us examine more closely: what is the scientific man?\nFirstly, a commonplace type of man, with commonplace virtues: that is\nto say, a non-ruling, non-authoritative, and non-self-sufficient type\nof man; he possesses industry, patient adaptableness to rank and file,\nequability and moderation in capacity and requirement; he has the\ninstinct for people like himself, and for that which they require--for\ninstance: the portion of independence and green meadow without which\nthere is no rest from labour, the claim to honour and consideration\n(which first and foremost presupposes recognition and recognisability),\nthe sunshine of a good name, the perpetual ratification of his value and\nusefulness, with which the inward DISTRUST which lies at the bottom of\nthe heart of all dependent men and gregarious animals, has again and\nagain to be overcome. The learned man, as is appropriate, has also\nmaladies and faults of an ignoble kind: he is full of petty envy, and\nhas a lynx-eye for the weak points in those natures to whose elevations\nhe cannot attain. He is confiding, yet only as one who lets himself go,\nbut does not FLOW; and precisely before the man of the great current he\nstands all the colder and more reserved--his eye is then like a smooth\nand irresponsive lake, which is no longer moved by rapture or sympathy.\nThe worst and most dangerous thing of which a scholar is capable results\nfrom the instinct of mediocrity of his type, from the Jesuitism of\nmediocrity, which labours instinctively for the destruction of\nthe exceptional man, and endeavours to break--or still better, to\nrelax--every bent bow To relax, of course, with consideration, and\nnaturally with an indulgent hand--to RELAX with confiding sympathy\nthat is the real art of Jesuitism, which has always understood how to\nintroduce itself as the religion of sympathy.\n"}

However gratefully one may welcome the OBJECTIVE spirit--and\nwho has not been sick to death of all subjectivity and its confounded\nIPSISIMOSITY!--in the end, however, one must learn caution even with\nregard to one's gratitude, and put a stop to the exaggeration with\nwhich the unselfing and depersonalizing of the spirit has recently been\ncelebrated, as if it were the goal in itself, as if it were salvation\nand glorification--as is especially accustomed to happen in the\npessimist school, which has also in its turn good reasons for paying the\nhighest honours to \"disinterested knowledge\" The objective man, who no\nlonger curses and scolds like the pessimist, the IDEAL man of learning\nin whom the scientific instinct blossoms forth fully after a thousand\ncomplete and partial failures, is assuredly one of the most costly\ninstruments that exist, but his place is in the hand of one who is more\npowerful He is only an instrument, we may say, he is a MIRROR--he is no\n\"purpose in himself\" The objective man is in truth a mirror accustomed\nto prostration before everything that wants to be known, with such\ndesires only as knowing or \"reflecting\" implies--he waits until\nsomething comes, and then expands himself sensitively, so that even the\nlight footsteps and gliding-past of spiritual beings may not be lost on\nhis surface and film Whatever \"personality\" he still possesses seems to\nhim accidental, arbitrary, or still oftener, disturbing, so much has he\ncome to regard himself as the passage and reflection of outside forms\nand events He calls up the recollection of \"himself\" with an effort,\nand not infrequently wrongly, he readily confounds himself with other\npersons, he makes mistakes with regard to his own needs, and here only\nis he unrefined and negligent Perhaps he is troubled about the health,\nor the pettiness and confined atmosphere of wife and friend, or the lack\nof companions and society--indeed, he sets himself to reflect on his\nsuffering, but in vain! His thoughts already rove away to the MORE\nGENERAL case, and tomorrow he knows as little as he knew yesterday how\nto help himself He does not now take himself seriously and devote time\nto himself he is serene, NOT from lack of trouble, but from lack\nof capacity for grasping and dealing with HIS trouble The habitual\ncomplaisance with respect to all objects and experiences, the radiant\nand impartial hospitality with which he receives everything that\ncomes his way, his habit of inconsiderate good-nature, of dangerous\nindifference as to Yea and Nay: alas! there are enough of cases in which\nhe has to atone for these virtues of his!--and as man generally, he\nbecomes far too easily the CAPUT MORTUUM of such virtues. Should one\nwish love or hatred from him--I mean love and hatred as God, woman, and\nanimal understand them--he will do what he can, and furnish what he can.\nBut one must not be surprised if it should not be much--if he should\nshow himself just at this point to be false, fragile, questionable, and\ndeteriorated. His love is constrained, his hatred is artificial, and\nrather UN TOUR DE FORCE, a slight ostentation and exaggeration. He is\nonly genuine so far as he can be objective; only in his serene totality\nis he still \"nature\" and \"natural.\" His mirroring and eternally\nself-polishing soul no longer knows how to affirm, no longer how to\ndeny; he does not command; neither does he destroy. \"JE NE MEPRISE\nPRESQUE RIEN\"--he says, with Leibniz: let us not overlook nor undervalue\nthe PRESQUE! Neither is he a model man; he does not go in advance of any\none, nor after, either; he places himself generally too far off to have\nany reason for espousing the cause of either good or evil. If he has\nbeen so long confounded with the PHILOSOPHER, with the Caesarian trainer\nand dictator of civilization, he has had far too much honour, and what\nis more essential in him has been overlooked--he is an instrument,\nsomething of a slave, though certainly the sublimest sort of slave, but\nnothing in himself--PRESQUE RIEN! The objective man is an instrument,\na costly, easily injured, easily tarnished measuring instrument and\nmirroring apparatus, which is to be taken care of and respected; but he\nis no goal, not outgoing nor upgoing, no complementary man in whom the\nREST of existence justifies itself, no termination--and still less a\ncommencement, an engendering, or primary cause, nothing hardy, powerful,\nself-centred, that wants to be master; but rather only a soft, inflated,\ndelicate, movable potter's-form, that must wait for some kind of content\nand frame to \"shape\" itself thereto--for the most part a man without\nframe and content, a \"selfless\" man. Consequently, also, nothing for\nwomen, IN PARENTHESI.\n"}
{"body": "208. When a philosopher nowadays makes known that he is not a skeptic--I\nhope that has been gathered from the foregoing description of the\nobjective spirit?--people all hear it impatiently; they regard him on\nthat account with some apprehension, they would like to ask so many,\nmany questions... indeed among timid hearers, of whom there are now so\nmany, he is henceforth said to be dangerous. With his repudiation of\nskepticism, it seems to them as if they heard some evil-threatening\nsound in the distance, as if a new kind of explosive were being tried\nsomewhere, a dynamite of the spirit, perhaps a newly discovered Russian\nNIHILINE, a pessimism BONAE VOLUNTATIS, that not only denies, means\ndenial, but--dreadful thought! PRACTISES denial. Against this kind of\n\"good-will\"--a will to the veritable, actual negation of life--there is,\nas is generally acknowledged nowadays, no better soporific and sedative\nthan skepticism, the mild, pleasing, lulling poppy of skepticism;\nand Hamlet himself is now prescribed by the doctors of the day as an\nantidote to the \"spirit,\" and its underground noises. \"Are not our ears\nalready full of bad sounds?\" say the skeptics, as lovers of repose, and\nalmost as a kind of safety police; \"this subterranean Nay is terrible!\nBe still, ye pessimistic moles!\" The skeptic, in effect, that delicate\ncreature, is far too easily frightened; his conscience is schooled so\nas to start at every Nay, and even at that sharp, decided Yea, and feels\nsomething like a bite thereby. Yea! and Nay!--they seem to him opposed\nto morality; he loves, on the contrary, to make a festival to his virtue\nby a noble aloofness, while perhaps he says with Montaigne: \"What do I\nknow?\" Or with Socrates: \"I know that I know nothing.\" Or: \"Here I do\nnot trust myself, no door is open to me.\" Or: \"Even if the door were\nopen, why should I enter immediately?\" Or: \"What is the use of any hasty\nhypotheses? It might quite well be in good taste to make no hypotheses\nat all. Are you absolutely obliged to straighten at once what is\ncrooked? to stuff every hole with some kind of oakum? Is there not time\nenough for that? Has not the time leisure? Oh, ye demons, can ye not\nat all WAIT? The uncertain also has its charms, the Sphinx, too, is a\nCirce, and Circe, too, was a philosopher.\"--Thus does a skeptic console\nhimself; and in truth he needs some consolation. For skepticism is\nthe most spiritual expression of a certain many-sided physiological\ntemperament, which in ordinary language is called nervous debility and\nsickliness; it arises whenever races or classes which have been long\nseparated, decisively and suddenly blend with one another. In the new\ngeneration, which has inherited as it were different standards and\nvaluations in its blood, everything is disquiet, derangement, doubt, and\ntentativeness; the best powers operate restrictively, the very virtues\nprevent each other growing and becoming strong, equilibrium, ballast,\nand perpendicular stability are lacking in body and soul. That, however,\nwhich is most diseased and degenerated in such nondescripts is the\nWILL; they are no longer familiar with independence of decision, or\nthe courageous feeling of pleasure in willing--they are doubtful of the\n\"freedom of the will\" even in their dreams Our present-day Europe,\nthe scene of a senseless, precipitate attempt at a radical blending of\nclasses, and CONSEQUENTLY of races, is therefore skeptical in all its\nheights and depths, sometimes exhibiting the mobile skepticism which\nsprings impatiently and wantonly from branch to branch, sometimes with\ngloomy aspect, like a cloud over-charged with interrogative signs--and\noften sick unto death of its will! Paralysis of will, where do we not\nfind this cripple sitting nowadays! And yet how bedecked oftentimes' How\nseductively ornamented! There are the finest gala dresses and disguises\nfor this disease, and that, for instance, most of what places itself\nnowadays in the show-cases as \"objectiveness,\" \"the scientific spirit,\"\n\"L'ART POUR L'ART,\" and \"pure voluntary knowledge,\" is only decked-out\nskepticism and paralysis of will--I am ready to answer for this\ndiagnosis of the European disease--The disease of the will is diffused\nunequally over Europe, it is worst and most varied where civilization\nhas longest prevailed, it decreases according as \"the barbarian\"\nstill--or again--asserts his claims under the loose drapery of Western\nculture It is therefore in the France of today, as can be readily\ndisclosed and comprehended, that the will is most infirm, and France,\nwhich has always had a masterly aptitude for converting even the\nportentous crises of its spirit into something charming and seductive,\nnow manifests emphatically its intellectual ascendancy over Europe,\nby being the school and exhibition of all the charms of skepticism The\npower to will and to persist, moreover, in a resolution, is already\nsomewhat stronger in Germany, and again in the North of Germany it\nis stronger than in Central Germany, it is considerably stronger in\nEngland, Spain, and Corsica, associated with phlegm in the former and\nwith hard skulls in the latter--not to mention Italy, which is too young\nyet to know what it wants, and must first show whether it can exercise\nwill, but it is strongest and most surprising of all in that immense\nmiddle empire where Europe as it were flows back to Asia--namely, in\nRussia There the power to will has been long stored up and accumulated,\nthere the will--uncertain whether to be negative or affirmative--waits\nthreateningly to be discharged (to borrow their pet phrase from our\nphysicists) Perhaps not only Indian wars and complications in Asia would\nbe necessary to free Europe from its greatest danger, but also internal\nsubversion, the shattering of the empire into small states, and above\nall the introduction of parliamentary imbecility, together with the\nobligation of every one to read his newspaper at breakfast I do not\nsay this as one who desires it, in my heart I should rather prefer the\ncontrary--I mean such an increase in the threatening attitude of\nRussia, that Europe would have to make up its mind to become equally\nthreatening--namely, TO ACQUIRE ONE WILL, by means of a new caste to\nrule over the Continent, a persistent, dreadful will of its own, that\ncan set its aims thousands of years ahead; so that the long spun-out\ncomedy of its petty-statism, and its dynastic as well as its democratic\nmany-willed-ness, might finally be brought to a close. The time for\npetty politics is past; the next century will bring the struggle for the\ndominion of the world--the COMPULSION to great politics.\n"}
{"body": "209. As to how far the new warlike age on which we Europeans have\nevidently entered may perhaps favour the growth of another and stronger\nkind of skepticism, I should like to express myself preliminarily\nmerely by a parable, which the lovers of German history will already\nunderstand. That unscrupulous enthusiast for big, handsome grenadiers\n(who, as King of Prussia, brought into being a military and skeptical\ngenius--and therewith, in reality, the new and now triumphantly emerged\ntype of German), the problematic, crazy father of Frederick the Great,\nhad on one point the very knack and lucky grasp of the genius: he knew\nwhat was then lacking in Germany, the want of which was a hundred times\nmore alarming and serious than any lack of culture and social form--his\nill-will to the young Frederick resulted from the anxiety of a profound\ninstinct. MEN WERE LACKING; and he suspected, to his bitterest regret,\nthat his own son was not man enough. There, however, he deceived\nhimself; but who would not have deceived himself in his place? He saw\nhis son lapsed to atheism, to the ESPRIT, to the pleasant frivolity of\nclever Frenchmen--he saw in the background the great bloodsucker, the\nspider skepticism; he suspected the incurable wretchedness of a heart no\nlonger hard enough either for evil or good, and of a broken will that no\nlonger commands, is no longer ABLE to command. Meanwhile, however,\nthere grew up in his son that new kind of harder and more dangerous\nskepticism--who knows TO WHAT EXTENT it was encouraged just by\nhis father's hatred and the icy melancholy of a will condemned to\nsolitude?--the skepticism of daring manliness, which is closely related\nto the genius for war and conquest, and made its first entrance into\nGermany in the person of the great Frederick. This skepticism despises\nand nevertheless grasps; it undermines and takes possession; it does\nnot believe, but it does not thereby lose itself; it gives the spirit a\ndangerous liberty, but it keeps strict guard over the heart. It is the\nGERMAN form of skepticism, which, as a continued Fredericianism, risen\nto the highest spirituality, has kept Europe for a considerable time\nunder the dominion of the German spirit and its critical and historical\ndistrust Owing to the insuperably strong and tough masculine character\nof the great German philologists and historical critics (who,\nrightly estimated, were also all of them artists of destruction\nand dissolution), a NEW conception of the German spirit gradually\nestablished itself--in spite of all Romanticism in music and\nphilosophy--in which the leaning towards masculine skepticism was\ndecidedly prominent whether, for instance, as fearlessness of gaze, as\ncourage and sternness of the dissecting hand, or as resolute will to\ndangerous voyages of discovery, to spiritualized North Pole expeditions\nunder barren and dangerous skies. There may be good grounds for it when\nwarm-blooded and superficial humanitarians cross themselves before this\nspirit, CET ESPRIT FATALISTE, IRONIQUE, MEPHISTOPHELIQUE, as Michelet\ncalls it, not without a shudder. But if one would realize how\ncharacteristic is this fear of the \"man\" in the German spirit which\nawakened Europe out of its \"dogmatic slumber,\" let us call to mind the\nformer conception which had to be overcome by this new one--and that\nit is not so very long ago that a masculinized woman could dare, with\nunbridled presumption, to recommend the Germans to the interest of\nEurope as gentle, good-hearted, weak-willed, and poetical fools.\nFinally, let us only understand profoundly enough Napoleon's\nastonishment when he saw Goethe it reveals what had been regarded for\ncenturies as the \"German spirit\" \"VOILA UN HOMME!\"--that was as much as\nto say \"But this is a MAN! And I only expected to see a German!\"\n"}
{"body": "210. Supposing, then, that in the picture of the philosophers of the\nfuture, some trait suggests the question whether they must not perhaps\nbe skeptics in the last-mentioned sense, something in them would only be\ndesignated thereby--and not they themselves. With equal right they might\ncall themselves critics, and assuredly they will be men of experiments.\nBy the name with which I ventured to baptize them, I have already\nexpressly emphasized their attempting and their love of attempting is\nthis because, as critics in body and soul, they will love to make use\nof experiments in a new, and perhaps wider and more dangerous sense? In\ntheir passion for knowledge, will they have to go further in daring and\npainful attempts than the sensitive and pampered taste of a democratic\ncentury can approve of?--There is no doubt these coming ones will be\nleast able to dispense with the serious and not unscrupulous qualities\nwhich distinguish the critic from the skeptic I mean the certainty as to\nstandards of worth, the conscious employment of a unity of method,\nthe wary courage, the standing-alone, and the capacity for\nself-responsibility, indeed, they will avow among themselves a DELIGHT\nin denial and dissection, and a certain considerate cruelty, which knows\nhow to handle the knife surely and deftly, even when the heart bleeds\nThey will be STERNER (and perhaps not always towards themselves only)\nthan humane people may desire, they will not deal with the \"truth\" in\norder that it may \"please\" them, or \"elevate\" and \"inspire\" them--they\nwill rather have little faith in \"TRUTH\" bringing with it such revels\nfor the feelings. They will smile, those rigorous spirits, when any one\nsays in their presence \"That thought elevates me, why should it not be\ntrue?\" or \"That work enchants me, why should it not be beautiful?\" or\n\"That artist enlarges me, why should he not be great?\" Perhaps they\nwill not only have a smile, but a genuine disgust for all that is thus\nrapturous, idealistic, feminine, and hermaphroditic, and if any one\ncould look into their inmost hearts, he would not easily find therein\nthe intention to reconcile \"Christian sentiments\" with \"antique taste,\"\nor even with \"modern parliamentarism\" (the kind of reconciliation\nnecessarily found even among philosophers in our very uncertain and\nconsequently very conciliatory century). Critical discipline, and every\nhabit that conduces to purity and rigour in intellectual matters,\nwill not only be demanded from themselves by these philosophers of\nthe future, they may even make a display thereof as their special\nadornment--nevertheless they will not want to be called critics on that\naccount. It will seem to them no small indignity to philosophy to\nhave it decreed, as is so welcome nowadays, that \"philosophy itself is\ncriticism and critical science--and nothing else whatever!\" Though this\nestimate of philosophy may enjoy the approval of all the Positivists of\nFrance and Germany (and possibly it even flattered the heart and taste\nof KANT: let us call to mind the titles of his principal works), our new\nphilosophers will say, notwithstanding, that critics are instruments of\nthe philosopher, and just on that account, as instruments, they are\nfar from being philosophers themselves! Even the great Chinaman of\nKonigsberg was only a great critic.\n"}
{"body": "211. I insist upon it that people finally cease confounding\nphilosophical workers, and in general scientific men, with\nphilosophers--that precisely here one should strictly give \"each his\nown,\" and not give those far too much, these far too little. It may\nbe necessary for the education of the real philosopher that he himself\nshould have once stood upon all those steps upon which his servants,\nthe scientific workers of philosophy, remain standing, and MUST remain\nstanding he himself must perhaps have been critic, and dogmatist,\nand historian, and besides, poet, and collector, and traveler, and\nriddle-reader, and moralist, and seer, and \"free spirit,\" and almost\neverything, in order to traverse the whole range of human values\nand estimations, and that he may BE ABLE with a variety of eyes and\nconsciences to look from a height to any distance, from a depth up\nto any height, from a nook into any expanse. But all these are only\npreliminary conditions for his task; this task itself demands something\nelse--it requires him TO CREATE VALUES. The philosophical workers, after\nthe excellent pattern of Kant and Hegel, have to fix and formalize some\ngreat existing body of valuations--that is to say, former DETERMINATIONS\nOF VALUE, creations of value, which have become prevalent, and are for\na time called \"truths\"--whether in the domain of the LOGICAL, the\nPOLITICAL (moral), or the ARTISTIC. It is for these investigators to\nmake whatever has happened and been esteemed hitherto, conspicuous,\nconceivable, intelligible, and manageable, to shorten everything long,\neven \"time\" itself, and to SUBJUGATE the entire past: an immense and\nwonderful task, in the carrying out of which all refined pride, all\ntenacious will, can surely find satisfaction. THE REAL PHILOSOPHERS,\nHOWEVER, ARE COMMANDERS AND LAW-GIVERS; they say: \"Thus SHALL it be!\"\nThey determine first the Whither and the Why of mankind, and thereby\nset aside the previous labour of all philosophical workers, and all\nsubjugators of the past--they grasp at the future with a creative\nhand, and whatever is and was, becomes for them thereby a means, an\ninstrument, and a hammer. Their \"knowing\" is CREATING, their creating\nis a law-giving, their will to truth is--WILL TO POWER.--Are there at\npresent such philosophers? Have there ever been such philosophers?

It is always more obvious to me that the philosopher, as a man\nINDISPENSABLE for the morrow and the day after the morrow, has ever\nfound himself, and HAS BEEN OBLIGED to find himself, in contradiction\nto the day in which he lives; his enemy has always been the ideal of his\nday. Hitherto all those extraordinary furtherers of humanity whom one\ncalls philosophers--who rarely regarded themselves as lovers of wisdom,\nbut rather as disagreeable fools and dangerous interrogators--have found\ntheir mission, their hard, involuntary, imperative mission (in the end,\nhowever, the greatness of their mission), in being the bad conscience of\ntheir age. In putting the vivisector's knife to the breast of the very\nVIRTUES OF THEIR AGE, they have betrayed their own secret; it has been\nfor the sake of a NEW greatness of man, a new untrodden path to\nhis aggrandizement. They have always disclosed how much hypocrisy,\nindolence, self-indulgence, and self-neglect, how much falsehood was\nconcealed under the most venerated types of contemporary morality, how\nmuch virtue was OUTLIVED, they have always said \"We must remove hence to\nwhere YOU are least at home\" In the face of a world of \"modern ideas,\"\nwhich would like to confine every one in a corner, in a \"specialty,\" a\nphilosopher, if there could be philosophers nowadays, would be compelled\nto place the greatness of man, the conception of \"greatness,\" precisely\nin his comprehensiveness and multifariousness, in his all-roundness, he\nwould even determine worth and rank according to the amount and variety\nof that which a man could bear and take upon himself, according to the\nEXTENT to which a man could stretch his responsibility Nowadays the\ntaste and virtue of the age weaken and attenuate the will, nothing is\nso adapted to the spirit of the age as weakness of will consequently, in\nthe ideal of the philosopher, strength of will, sternness, and capacity\nfor prolonged resolution, must specially be included in the conception\nof \"greatness\", with as good a right as the opposite doctrine, with its\nideal of a silly, renouncing, humble, selfless humanity, was suited to\nan opposite age--such as the sixteenth century, which suffered from its\naccumulated energy of will, and from the wildest torrents and floods\nof selfishness In the time of Socrates, among men only of worn-out\ninstincts, old conservative Athenians who let themselves go--\"for the\nsake of happiness,\" as they said, for the sake of pleasure, as their\nconduct indicated--and who had continually on their lips the old pompous\nwords to which they had long forfeited the right by the life they led,\nIRONY was perhaps necessary for greatness of soul, the wicked Socratic\nassurance of the old physician and plebeian, who cut ruthlessly into his\nown flesh, as into the flesh and heart of the \"noble,\" with a look that\nsaid plainly enough \"Do not dissemble before me! here--we are equal!\"\nAt present, on the contrary, when throughout Europe the herding-animal\nalone attains to honours, and dispenses honours, when \"equality of\nright\" can too readily be transformed into equality in wrong--I mean to\nsay into general war against everything rare, strange, and privileged,\nagainst the higher man, the higher soul, the higher duty, the higher\nresponsibility, the creative plenipotence and lordliness--at present\nit belongs to the conception of \"greatness\" to be noble, to wish to be\napart, to be capable of being different, to stand alone, to have to live\nby personal initiative, and the philosopher will betray something of his\nown ideal when he asserts \"He shall be the greatest who can be the most\nsolitary, the most concealed, the most divergent, the man beyond good\nand evil, the master of his virtues, and of super-abundance of will;\nprecisely this shall be called GREATNESS: as diversified as can be\nentire, as ample as can be full.\" And to ask once more the question: Is\ngreatness POSSIBLE--nowadays?\n"}
{"body": "213. It is difficult to learn what a philosopher is, because it cannot\nbe taught: one must \"know\" it by experience--or one should have the\npride NOT to know it. The fact that at present people all talk of things\nof which they CANNOT have any experience, is true more especially\nand unfortunately as concerns the philosopher and philosophical\nmatters:--the very few know them, are permitted to know them, and\nall popular ideas about them are false. Thus, for instance, the truly\nphilosophical combination of a bold, exuberant spirituality which runs\nat presto pace, and a dialectic rigour and necessity which makes no\nfalse step, is unknown to most thinkers and scholars from their own\nexperience, and therefore, should any one speak of it in their\npresence, it is incredible to them. They conceive of every necessity as\ntroublesome, as a painful compulsory obedience and state of constraint;\nthinking itself is regarded by them as something slow and hesitating,\nalmost as a trouble, and often enough as \"worthy of the SWEAT of the\nnoble\"--but not at all as something easy and divine, closely related\nto dancing and exuberance! \"To think\" and to take a matter \"seriously,\"\n\"arduously\"--that is one and the same thing to them; such only has been\ntheir \"experience.\"--Artists have here perhaps a finer intuition; they\nwho know only too well that precisely when they no longer do anything\n\"arbitrarily,\" and everything of necessity, their feeling of freedom,\nof subtlety, of power, of creatively fixing, disposing, and shaping,\nreaches its climax--in short, that necessity and \"freedom of will\" are\nthen the same thing with them. There is, in fine, a gradation of rank\nin psychical states, to which the gradation of rank in the problems\ncorresponds; and the highest problems repel ruthlessly every one who\nventures too near them, without being predestined for their solution\nby the loftiness and power of his spirituality. Of what use is it for\nnimble, everyday intellects, or clumsy, honest mechanics and empiricists\nto press, in their plebeian ambition, close to such problems, and as\nit were into this \"holy of holies\"--as so often happens nowadays!

Many generations must have prepared the way\nfor the coming of the philosopher; each of his virtues must have been\nseparately acquired, nurtured, transmitted, and embodied; not only the\nbold, easy, delicate course and current of his thoughts, but above all\nthe readiness for great responsibilities, the majesty of ruling glance\nand contemning look, the feeling of separation from the multitude with\ntheir duties and virtues, the kindly patronage and defense of whatever\nis misunderstood and calumniated, be it God or devil, the delight and\npractice of supreme justice, the art of commanding, the amplitude of\nwill, the lingering eye which rarely admires, rarely looks up, rarely\nloves....\n"}

The fact thereby becomes obvious that the\ngreater part of what interests and charms higher natures, and more\nrefined and fastidious tastes, seems absolutely \"uninteresting\" to\nthe average man--if, notwithstanding, he perceive devotion to these\ninterests, he calls it desinteresse, and wonders how it is possible to\nact \"disinterestedly.\" There have been philosophers who could give this\npopular astonishment a seductive and mystical, other-worldly expression\n(perhaps because they did not know the higher nature by experience?),\ninstead of stating the naked and candidly reasonable truth that\n\"disinterested\" action is very interesting and \"interested\" action,\nprovided that... \"And love?\"--What!

Owing to this mingling, the past of every\nform and mode of life, and of cultures which were formerly closely\ncontiguous and superimposed on one another, flows forth into us \"modern\nsouls\"; our instincts now run back in all directions, we ourselves are\na kind of chaos: in the end, as we have said, the spirit perceives its\nadvantage therein. By means of our semi-barbarity in body and in desire,\nwe have secret access everywhere, such as a noble age never had; we have\naccess above all to the labyrinth of imperfect civilizations, and to\nevery form of semi-barbarity that has at any time existed on earth; and\nin so far as the most considerable part of human civilization hitherto\nhas just been semi-barbarity, the \"historical sense\" implies almost the\nsense and instinct for everything, the taste and tongue for everything:\nwhereby it immediately proves itself to be an IGNOBLE sense. For\ninstance, we enjoy Homer once more: it is perhaps our happiest\nacquisition that we know how to appreciate Homer, whom men of\ndistinguished culture (as the French of the seventeenth century, like\nSaint-Evremond, who reproached him for his ESPRIT VASTE, and even\nVoltaire, the last echo of the century) cannot and could not so easily\nappropriate--whom they scarcely permitted themselves to enjoy. The very\ndecided Yea and Nay of their palate, their promptly ready disgust, their\nhesitating reluctance with regard to everything strange, their horror of\nthe bad taste even of lively curiosity, and in general the averseness of\nevery distinguished and self-sufficing culture to avow a new desire,\na dissatisfaction with its own condition, or an admiration of what is\nstrange: all this determines and disposes them unfavourably even towards\nthe best things of the world which are not their property or could not\nbecome their prey--and no faculty is more unintelligible to such men\nthan just this historical sense, with its truckling, plebeian\ncuriosity. The case is not different with Shakespeare, that marvelous\nSpanish-Moorish-Saxon synthesis of taste, over whom an ancient Athenian\nof the circle of AEschylus would have half-killed himself with laughter\nor irritation: but we--accept precisely this wild motleyness, this\nmedley of the most delicate, the most coarse, and the most artificial,\nwith a secret confidence and cordiality; we enjoy it as a refinement\nof art reserved expressly for us, and allow ourselves to be as little\ndisturbed by the repulsive fumes and the proximity of the English\npopulace in which Shakespeare's art and taste lives, as perhaps on\nthe Chiaja of Naples, where, with all our senses awake, we go our way,\nenchanted and voluntarily, in spite of the drain-odour of the lower\nquarters of the town. That as men of the \"historical sense\" we have\nour virtues, is not to be disputed:--we are unpretentious, unselfish,\nmodest, brave, habituated to self-control and self-renunciation, very\ngrateful, very patient, very complaisant--but with all this we are\nperhaps not very \"tasteful.\" Let us finally confess it, that what is\nmost difficult for us men of the \"historical sense\" to grasp, feel,\ntaste, and love, what finds us fundamentally prejudiced and almost\nhostile, is precisely the perfection and ultimate maturity in every\nculture and art, the essentially noble in works and men, their moment\nof smooth sea and halcyon self-sufficiency, the goldenness and coldness\nwhich all things show that have perfected themselves. Perhaps our great\nvirtue of the historical sense is in necessary contrast to GOOD taste,\nat least to the very bad taste; and we can only evoke in ourselves\nimperfectly, hesitatingly, and with compulsion the small, short, and\nhappy godsends and glorifications of human life as they shine here and\nthere: those moments and marvelous experiences when a great power has\nvoluntarily come to a halt before the boundless and infinite,--when a\nsuper-abundance of refined delight has been enjoyed by a sudden checking\nand petrifying, by standing firmly and planting oneself fixedly on still\ntrembling ground. PROPORTIONATENESS is strange to us, let us confess it\nto ourselves; our itching is really the itching for the infinite, the\nimmeasurable.

It\nis desirable that as few people as possible should reflect upon morals,\nand consequently it is very desirable that morals should not some day\nbecome interesting! But let us not be afraid! Things still remain today\nas they have always been: I see no one in Europe who has (or DISCLOSES)\nan idea of the fact that philosophizing concerning morals might be\nconducted in a dangerous, captious, and ensnaring manner--that CALAMITY\nmight be involved therein. Observe, for example, the indefatigable,\ninevitable English utilitarians: how ponderously and respectably they\nstalk on, stalk along (a Homeric metaphor expresses it better) in the\nfootsteps of Bentham, just as he had already stalked in the footsteps of\nthe respectable Helvetius! (no, he was not a dangerous man, Helvetius,\nCE SENATEUR POCOCURANTE, to use an expression of Galiani). No new\nthought, nothing of the nature of a finer turning or better expression\nof an old thought, not even a proper history of what has been previously\nthought on the subject: an IMPOSSIBLE literature, taking it all in all,\nunless one knows how to leaven it with some mischief. In effect, the\nold English vice called CANT, which is MORAL TARTUFFISM, has insinuated\nitself also into these moralists (whom one must certainly read with an\neye to their motives if one MUST read them), concealed this time under\nthe new form of the scientific spirit; moreover, there is not absent\nfrom them a secret struggle with the pangs of conscience, from which a\nrace of former Puritans must naturally suffer, in all their scientific\ntinkering with morals. (Is not a moralist the opposite of a Puritan?\nThat is to say, as a thinker who regards morality as questionable,\nas worthy of interrogation, in short, as a problem? Is moralizing\nnot-immoral?) In the end, they all want English morality to be\nrecognized as authoritative, inasmuch as mankind, or the \"general\nutility,\" or \"the happiness of the greatest number,\"--no! the happiness\nof ENGLAND, will be best served thereby.

Almost everything that we call \"higher culture\"\nis based upon the spiritualising and intensifying of CRUELTY--this is\nmy thesis; the \"wild beast\" has not been slain at all, it lives, it\nflourishes, it has only been--transfigured. That which constitutes the\npainful delight of tragedy is cruelty; that which operates agreeably in\nso-called tragic sympathy, and at the basis even of everything sublime,\nup to the highest and most delicate thrills of metaphysics, obtains its\nsweetness solely from the intermingled ingredient of cruelty.

{"body": "230. Perhaps what I have said here about a \"fundamental will of the\nspirit\" may not be understood without further details; I may be allowed\na word of explanation.--That imperious something which is popularly\ncalled \"the spirit,\" wishes to be master internally and externally,\nand to feel itself master; it has the will of a multiplicity for a\nsimplicity, a binding, taming, imperious, and essentially ruling will.\nIts requirements and capacities here, are the same as those assigned by\nphysiologists to everything that lives, grows, and multiplies. The power\nof the spirit to appropriate foreign elements reveals itself in a strong\ntendency to assimilate the new to the old, to simplify the manifold,\nto overlook or repudiate the absolutely contradictory; just as it\narbitrarily re-underlines, makes prominent, and falsifies for itself\ncertain traits and lines in the foreign elements, in every portion of\nthe \"outside world.\" Its object thereby is the incorporation of new\n\"experiences,\" the assortment of new things in the old arrangements--in\nshort, growth; or more properly, the FEELING of growth, the feeling of\nincreased power--is its object. This same will has at its service an\napparently opposed impulse of the spirit, a suddenly adopted preference\nof ignorance, of arbitrary shutting out, a closing of windows, an inner\ndenial of this or that, a prohibition to approach, a sort of defensive\nattitude against much that is knowable, a contentment with obscurity,\nwith the shutting-in horizon, an acceptance and approval of ignorance:\nas that which is all necessary according to the degree of its\nappropriating power, its \"digestive power,\" to speak figuratively (and\nin fact \"the spirit\" resembles a stomach more than anything else). Here\nalso belong an occasional propensity of the spirit to let itself be\ndeceived (perhaps with a waggish suspicion that it is NOT so and so,\nbut is only allowed to pass as such), a delight in uncertainty and\nambiguity, an exulting enjoyment of arbitrary, out-of-the-way narrowness\nand mystery, of the too-near, of the foreground, of the magnified,\nthe diminished, the misshapen, the beautified--an enjoyment of the\narbitrariness of all these manifestations of power. Finally, in this\nconnection, there is the not unscrupulous readiness of the spirit to\ndeceive other spirits and dissemble before them--the constant pressing\nand straining of a creating, shaping, changeable power: the spirit\nenjoys therein its craftiness and its variety of disguises, it enjoys\nalso its feeling of security therein--it is precisely by its Protean\narts that it is best protected and concealed!--COUNTER TO this\npropensity for appearance, for simplification, for a disguise, for a\ncloak, in short, for an outside--for every outside is a cloak--there\noperates the sublime tendency of the man of knowledge, which takes, and\nINSISTS on taking things profoundly, variously, and thoroughly; as a\nkind of cruelty of the intellectual conscience and taste, which every\ncourageous thinker will acknowledge in himself, provided, as it ought\nto be, that he has sharpened and hardened his eye sufficiently long for\nintrospection, and is accustomed to severe discipline and even severe\nwords. He will say: \"There is something cruel in the tendency of my\nspirit\": let the virtuous and amiable try to convince him that it is not\nso! In fact, it would sound nicer, if, instead of our cruelty, perhaps\nour \"extravagant honesty\" were talked about, whispered about, and\nglorified--we free, VERY free spirits--and some day perhaps SUCH will\nactually be our--posthumous glory! Meanwhile--for there is plenty of\ntime until then--we should be least inclined to deck ourselves out in\nsuch florid and fringed moral verbiage; our whole former work has\njust made us sick of this taste and its sprightly exuberance.

For what must these\nclumsy attempts of feminine scientificality and self-exposure bring\nto light! Woman has so much cause for shame; in woman there is so\nmuch pedantry, superficiality, schoolmasterliness, petty presumption,\nunbridledness, and indiscretion concealed--study only woman's behaviour\ntowards children!--which has really been best restrained and dominated\nhitherto by the FEAR of man. Alas, if ever the \"eternally tedious in\nwoman\"--she has plenty of it!--is allowed to venture forth! if she\nbegins radically and on principle to unlearn her wisdom and art-of\ncharming, of playing, of frightening away sorrow, of alleviating and\ntaking easily; if she forgets her delicate aptitude for agreeable\ndesires! Female voices are already raised, which, by Saint Aristophanes!\nmake one afraid:--with medical explicitness it is stated in a\nthreatening manner what woman first and last REQUIRES from man. Is\nit not in the very worst taste that woman thus sets herself up to be\nscientific? Enlightenment hitherto has fortunately been men's affair,\nmen's gift--we remained therewith \"among ourselves\"; and in the end,\nin view of all that women write about \"woman,\" we may well have\nconsiderable doubt as to whether woman really DESIRES enlightenment\nabout herself--and CAN desire it. If woman does not thereby seek a new\nORNAMENT for herself--I believe ornamentation belongs to the eternally\nfeminine?--why, then, she wishes to make herself feared: perhaps she\nthereby wishes to get the mastery. But she does not want truth--what\ndoes woman care for truth? From the very first, nothing is more foreign,\nmore repugnant, or more hostile to woman than truth--her great art is\nfalsehood, her chief concern is appearance and beauty. Let us confess\nit, we men: we honour and love this very art and this very instinct in\nwoman: we who have the hard task, and for our recreation gladly seek the\ncompany of beings under whose hands, glances, and delicate follies, our\nseriousness, our gravity, and profundity appear almost like follies to\nus. Finally, I ask the question: Did a woman herself ever acknowledge\nprofundity in a woman's mind, or justice in a woman's heart? And is it\nnot true that on the whole \"woman\" has hitherto been most despised by\nwoman herself, and not at all by us?--We men desire that woman should\nnot continue to compromise herself by enlightening us; just as it was\nman's care and the consideration for woman, when the church decreed:\nmulier taceat in ecclesia. It was to the benefit of woman when Napoleon\ngave the too eloquent Madame de Stael to understand: mulier taceat in\npoliticis!--and in my opinion, he is a true friend of woman who calls\nout to women today: mulier taceat de mulierel.\n"}
{"body": "233. It betrays corruption of the instincts--apart from the fact that\nit betrays bad taste--when a woman refers to Madame Roland, or Madame de\nStael, or Monsieur George Sand, as though something were proved thereby\nin favour of \"woman as she is.\" Among men, these are the three comical\nwomen as they are--nothing more!--and just the best involuntary\ncounter-arguments against feminine emancipation and autonomy.\n"}

{"body": "238. To be mistaken in the fundamental problem of \"man and woman,\" to\ndeny here the profoundest antagonism and the necessity for an eternally\nhostile tension, to dream here perhaps of equal rights, equal\ntraining, equal claims and obligations: that is a TYPICAL sign of\nshallow-mindedness; and a thinker who has proved himself shallow at\nthis dangerous spot--shallow in instinct!--may generally be regarded as\nsuspicious, nay more, as betrayed, as discovered; he will probably prove\ntoo \"short\" for all fundamental questions of life, future as well as\npresent, and will be unable to descend into ANY of the depths. On the\nother hand, a man who has depth of spirit as well as of desires, and\nhas also the depth of benevolence which is capable of severity and\nharshness, and easily confounded with them, can only think of woman as\nORIENTALS do: he must conceive of her as a possession, as confinable\nproperty, as a being predestined for service and accomplishing her\nmission therein--he must take his stand in this matter upon the immense\nrationality of Asia, upon the superiority of the instinct of Asia, as\nthe Greeks did formerly; those best heirs and scholars of Asia--who,\nas is well known, with their INCREASING culture and amplitude of power,\nfrom Homer to the time of Pericles, became gradually STRICTER towards\nwoman, in short, more Oriental. HOW necessary, HOW logical, even HOW\nhumanely desirable this was, let us consider for ourselves!\n"}
{"body": "239. The weaker sex has in no previous age been treated with so\nmuch respect by men as at present--this belongs to the tendency and\nfundamental taste of democracy, in the same way as disrespectfulness to\nold age--what wonder is it that abuse should be immediately made of\nthis respect? They want more, they learn to make claims, the tribute\nof respect is at last felt to be well-nigh galling; rivalry for rights,\nindeed actual strife itself, would be preferred: in a word, woman is\nlosing modesty. And let us immediately add that she is also losing\ntaste. She is unlearning to FEAR man: but the woman who \"unlearns to\nfear\" sacrifices her most womanly instincts. That woman should venture\nforward when the fear-inspiring quality in man--or more definitely,\nthe MAN in man--is no longer either desired or fully developed, is\nreasonable enough and also intelligible enough; what is more difficult\nto understand is that precisely thereby--woman deteriorates. This is\nwhat is happening nowadays: let us not deceive ourselves about it!\nWherever the industrial spirit has triumphed over the military\nand aristocratic spirit, woman strives for the economic and legal\nindependence of a clerk: \"woman as clerkess\" is inscribed on the portal\nof the modern society which is in course of formation. While she\nthus appropriates new rights, aspires to be \"master,\" and inscribes\n\"progress\" of woman on her flags and banners, the very opposite realises\nitself with terrible obviousness: WOMAN RETROGRADES. Since the French\nRevolution the influence of woman in Europe has DECLINED in proportion\nas she has increased her rights and claims; and the \"emancipation of\nwoman,\" insofar as it is desired and demanded by women themselves (and\nnot only by masculine shallow-pates), thus proves to be a remarkable\nsymptom of the increased weakening and deadening of the most womanly\ninstincts. There is STUPIDITY in this movement, an almost masculine\nstupidity, of which a well-reared woman--who is always a sensible\nwoman--might be heartily ashamed. To lose the intuition as to the ground\nupon which she can most surely achieve victory; to neglect exercise in\nthe use of her proper weapons; to let-herself-go before man, perhaps\neven \"to the book,\" where formerly she kept herself in control and in\nrefined, artful humility; to neutralize with her virtuous audacity man's\nfaith in a VEILED, fundamentally different ideal in woman, something\neternally, necessarily feminine; to emphatically and loquaciously\ndissuade man from the idea that woman must be preserved, cared for,\nprotected, and indulged, like some delicate, strangely wild, and\noften pleasant domestic animal; the clumsy and indignant collection of\neverything of the nature of servitude and bondage which the position of\nwoman in the hitherto existing order of society has entailed and still\nentails (as though slavery were a counter-argument, and not rather a\ncondition of every higher culture, of every elevation of culture):--what\ndoes all this betoken, if not a disintegration of womanly instincts,\na defeminising? Certainly, there are enough of idiotic friends and\ncorrupters of woman among the learned asses of the masculine sex, who\nadvise woman to defeminize herself in this manner, and to imitate\nall the stupidities from which \"man\" in Europe, European \"manliness,\"\nsuffers,--who would like to lower woman to \"general culture,\" indeed\neven to newspaper reading and meddling with politics. Here and there\nthey wish even to make women into free spirits and literary workers: as\nthough a woman without piety would not be something perfectly obnoxious\nor ludicrous to a profound and godless man;--almost everywhere her\nnerves are being ruined by the most morbid and dangerous kind of music\n(our latest German music), and she is daily being made more hysterical\nand more incapable of fulfilling her first and last function, that of\nbearing robust children. They wish to \"cultivate\" her in general still\nmore, and intend, as they say, to make the \"weaker sex\" STRONG by\nculture: as if history did not teach in the most emphatic manner that\nthe \"cultivating\" of mankind and his weakening--that is to say, the\nweakening, dissipating, and languishing of his FORCE OF WILL--have\nalways kept pace with one another, and that the most powerful and\ninfluential women in the world (and lastly, the mother of Napoleon)\nhad just to thank their force of will--and not their schoolmasters--for\ntheir power and ascendancy over men. That which inspires respect\nin woman, and often enough fear also, is her NATURE, which is more\n\"natural\" than that of man, her genuine, carnivora-like, cunning\nflexibility, her tiger-claws beneath the glove, her NAIVETE in egoism,\nher untrainableness and innate wildness, the incomprehensibleness,\nextent, and deviation of her desires and virtues. That which, in spite\nof fear, excites one's sympathy for the dangerous and beautiful cat,\n\"woman,\" is that she seems more afflicted, more vulnerable, more\nnecessitous of love, and more condemned to disillusionment than any\nother creature. Fear and sympathy it is with these feelings that man has\nhitherto stood in the presence of woman, always with one foot already in\ntragedy, which rends while it delights--What? And all that is now to\nbe at an end? And the DISENCHANTMENT of woman is in progress? The\ntediousness of woman is slowly evolving? Oh Europe! Europe! We know\nthe horned animal which was always most attractive to thee, from which\ndanger is ever again threatening thee!

I HEARD, once again for the first time, Richard Wagner's overture\nto the Mastersinger: it is a piece of magnificent, gorgeous, heavy,\nlatter-day art, which has the pride to presuppose two centuries of music\nas still living, in order that it may be understood:--it is an honour\nto Germans that such a pride did not miscalculate! What flavours\nand forces, what seasons and climes do we not find mingled in it! It\nimpresses us at one time as ancient, at another time as foreign, bitter,\nand too modern, it is as arbitrary as it is pompously traditional, it\nis not infrequently roguish, still oftener rough and coarse--it has fire\nand courage, and at the same time the loose, dun-coloured skin of fruits\nwhich ripen too late. It flows broad and full: and suddenly there is a\nmoment of inexplicable hesitation, like a gap that opens between cause\nand effect, an oppression that makes us dream, almost a nightmare; but\nalready it broadens and widens anew, the old stream of delight--the most\nmanifold delight,--of old and new happiness; including ESPECIALLY\nthe joy of the artist in himself, which he refuses to conceal, his\nastonished, happy cognizance of his mastery of the expedients here\nemployed, the new, newly acquired, imperfectly tested expedients of art\nwhich he apparently betrays to us. All in all, however, no beauty, no\nSouth, nothing of the delicate southern clearness of the sky, nothing\nof grace, no dance, hardly a will to logic; a certain clumsiness even,\nwhich is also emphasized, as though the artist wished to say to us: \"It\nis part of my intention\"; a cumbersome drapery, something arbitrarily\nbarbaric and ceremonious, a flirring of learned and venerable conceits\nand witticisms; something German in the best and worst sense of\nthe word, something in the German style, manifold, formless, and\ninexhaustible; a certain German potency and super-plenitude of\nsoul, which is not afraid to hide itself under the RAFFINEMENTS of\ndecadence--which, perhaps, feels itself most at ease there; a real,\ngenuine token of the German soul, which is at the same time young and\naged, too ripe and yet still too rich in futurity.

{"body": "241. We \"good Europeans,\" we also have hours when we allow ourselves a\nwarm-hearted patriotism, a plunge and relapse into old loves and narrow\nviews--I have just given an example of it--hours of national excitement,\nof patriotic anguish, and all other sorts of old-fashioned floods of\nsentiment. Duller spirits may perhaps only get done with what confines\nits operations in us to hours and plays itself out in hours--in a\nconsiderable time: some in half a year, others in half a lifetime,\naccording to the speed and strength with which they digest and \"change\ntheir material.\" Indeed, I could think of sluggish, hesitating races,\nwhich even in our rapidly moving Europe, would require half a century\nere they could surmount such atavistic attacks of patriotism and\nsoil-attachment, and return once more to reason, that is to say, to\n\"good Europeanism.\" And while digressing on this possibility, I\nhappen to become an ear-witness of a conversation between two old\npatriots--they were evidently both hard of hearing and consequently\nspoke all the louder. \"HE has as much, and knows as much, philosophy as\na peasant or a corps-student,\" said the one--\"he is still innocent. But\nwhat does that matter nowadays! It is the age of the masses: they lie on\ntheir belly before everything that is massive. And so also in politicis.\nA statesman who rears up for them a new Tower of Babel, some monstrosity\nof empire and power, they call 'great'--what does it matter that we more\nprudent and conservative ones do not meanwhile give up the old belief\nthat it is only the great thought that gives greatness to an action or\naffair. Supposing a statesman were to bring his people into the position\nof being obliged henceforth to practise 'high politics,' for which they\nwere by nature badly endowed and prepared, so that they would have\nto sacrifice their old and reliable virtues, out of love to a new and\ndoubtful mediocrity;--supposing a statesman were to condemn his people\ngenerally to 'practise politics,' when they have hitherto had something\nbetter to do and think about, and when in the depths of their souls\nthey have been unable to free themselves from a prudent loathing of\nthe restlessness, emptiness, and noisy wranglings of the essentially\npolitics-practising nations;--supposing such a statesman were to\nstimulate the slumbering passions and avidities of his people, were to\nmake a stigma out of their former diffidence and delight in aloofness,\nan offence out of their exoticism and hidden permanency, were to\ndepreciate their most radical proclivities, subvert their consciences,\nmake their minds narrow, and their tastes 'national'--what! a statesman\nwho should do all this, which his people would have to do penance for\nthroughout their whole future, if they had a future, such a statesman\nwould be GREAT, would he?\"--\"Undoubtedly!\" replied the other old patriot\nvehemently, \"otherwise he COULD NOT have done it! It was mad perhaps to\nwish such a thing! But perhaps everything great has been just as mad\nat its commencement!\"--\"Misuse of words!\" cried his interlocutor,\ncontradictorily--\"strong! strong! Strong and mad! NOT great!\"--The old\nmen had obviously become heated as they thus shouted their \"truths\" in\neach other's faces, but I, in my happiness and apartness, considered how\nsoon a stronger one may become master of the strong, and also that\nthere is a compensation for the intellectual superficialising of a\nnation--namely, in the deepening of another.\n"}

Whether we call it \"civilization,\" or \"humanising,\" or \"progress,\"\nwhich now distinguishes the European, whether we call it simply, without\npraise or blame, by the political formula the DEMOCRATIC movement in\nEurope--behind all the moral and political foregrounds pointed to by\nsuch formulas, an immense PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESS goes on, which is ever\nextending the process of the assimilation of Europeans, their\nincreasing detachment from the conditions under which, climatically and\nhereditarily, united races originate, their increasing independence of\nevery definite milieu, that for centuries would fain inscribe itself\nwith equal demands on soul and body,--that is to say, the slow emergence\nof an essentially SUPER-NATIONAL and nomadic species of man, who\npossesses, physiologically speaking, a maximum of the art and power\nof adaptation as his typical distinction. This process of the EVOLVING\nEUROPEAN, which can be retarded in its TEMPO by great relapses, but\nwill perhaps just gain and grow thereby in vehemence and depth--the\nstill-raging storm and stress of \"national sentiment\" pertains to it,\nand also the anarchism which is appearing at present--this process\nwill probably arrive at results on which its naive propagators and\npanegyrists, the apostles of \"modern ideas,\" would least care to reckon.\nThe same new conditions under which on an average a levelling and\nmediocrising of man will take place--a useful, industrious, variously\nserviceable, and clever gregarious man--are in the highest degree\nsuitable to give rise to exceptional men of the most dangerous and\nattractive qualities. For, while the capacity for adaptation, which is\nevery day trying changing conditions, and begins a new work with every\ngeneration, almost with every decade, makes the POWERFULNESS of the type\nimpossible; while the collective impression of such future Europeans\nwill probably be that of numerous, talkative, weak-willed, and very\nhandy workmen who REQUIRE a master, a commander, as they require their\ndaily bread; while, therefore, the democratising of Europe will tend to\nthe production of a type prepared for SLAVERY in the most subtle\nsense of the term: the STRONG man will necessarily in individual and\nexceptional cases, become stronger and richer than he has perhaps ever\nbeen before--owing to the unprejudicedness of his schooling, owing to\nthe immense variety of practice, art, and disguise.

{"body": "244. There was a time when it was customary to call Germans \"deep\"\nby way of distinction; but now that the most successful type of new\nGermanism is covetous of quite other honours, and perhaps misses\n\"smartness\" in all that has depth, it is almost opportune and patriotic\nto doubt whether we did not formerly deceive ourselves with that\ncommendation: in short, whether German depth is not at bottom something\ndifferent and worse--and something from which, thank God, we are on the\npoint of successfully ridding ourselves. Let us try, then, to relearn\nwith regard to German depth; the only thing necessary for the purpose is\na little vivisection of the German soul.--The German soul is above all\nmanifold, varied in its source, aggregated and super-imposed, rather\nthan actually built: this is owing to its origin. A German who would\nembolden himself to assert: \"Two souls, alas, dwell in my breast,\" would\nmake a bad guess at the truth, or, more correctly, he would come far\nshort of the truth about the number of souls. As a people made up of\nthe most extraordinary mixing and mingling of races, perhaps even with a\npreponderance of the pre-Aryan element as the \"people of the centre\" in\nevery sense of the term, the Germans are more intangible, more ample,\nmore contradictory, more unknown, more incalculable, more surprising,\nand even more terrifying than other peoples are to themselves:--they\nescape DEFINITION, and are thereby alone the despair of the French. It\nIS characteristic of the Germans that the question: \"What is German?\"\nnever dies out among them. Kotzebue certainly knew his Germans well\nenough: \"We are known,\" they cried jubilantly to him--but Sand also\nthought he knew them. Jean Paul knew what he was doing when he declared\nhimself incensed at Fichte's lying but patriotic flatteries and\nexaggerations,--but it is probable that Goethe thought differently about\nGermans from Jean Paul, even though he acknowledged him to be right with\nregard to Fichte. It is a question what Goethe really thought about the\nGermans?--But about many things around him he never spoke explicitly,\nand all his life he knew how to keep an astute silence--probably he\nhad good reason for it. It is certain that it was not the \"Wars of\nIndependence\" that made him look up more joyfully, any more than it was\nthe French Revolution,--the event on account of which he RECONSTRUCTED\nhis \"Faust,\" and indeed the whole problem of \"man,\" was the appearance\nof Napoleon. There are words of Goethe in which he condemns with\nimpatient severity, as from a foreign land, that which Germans take a\npride in, he once defined the famous German turn of mind as \"Indulgence\ntowards its own and others' weaknesses.\" Was he wrong? it is\ncharacteristic of Germans that one is seldom entirely wrong about them.\nThe German soul has passages and galleries in it, there are caves,\nhiding-places, and dungeons therein, its disorder has much of the charm\nof the mysterious, the German is well acquainted with the bypaths to\nchaos. And as everything loves its symbol, so the German loves the\nclouds and all that is obscure, evolving, crepuscular, damp, and\nshrouded, it seems to him that everything uncertain, undeveloped,\nself-displacing, and growing is \"deep\". The German himself does not\nEXIST, he is BECOMING, he is \"developing himself\". \"Development\" is\ntherefore the essentially German discovery and hit in the great domain\nof philosophical formulas,--a ruling idea, which, together with German\nbeer and German music, is labouring to Germanise all Europe. Foreigners\nare astonished and attracted by the riddles which the conflicting nature\nat the basis of the German soul propounds to them (riddles which\nHegel systematised and Richard Wagner has in the end set to music).\n\"Good-natured and spiteful\"--such a juxtaposition, preposterous in the\ncase of every other people, is unfortunately only too often justified\nin Germany one has only to live for a while among Swabians to know this!\nThe clumsiness of the German scholar and his social distastefulness\nagree alarmingly well with his physical rope-dancing and nimble\nboldness, of which all the Gods have learnt to be afraid. If any one\nwishes to see the \"German soul\" demonstrated ad oculos, let him\nonly look at German taste, at German arts and manners what boorish\nindifference to \"taste\"! How the noblest and the commonest stand there\nin juxtaposition! How disorderly and how rich is the whole constitution\nof this soul! The German DRAGS at his soul, he drags at everything he\nexperiences. He digests his events badly; he never gets \"done\"\nwith them; and German depth is often only a difficult, hesitating\n\"digestion.\" And just as all chronic invalids, all dyspeptics like what\nis convenient, so the German loves \"frankness\" and \"honesty\"; it is\nso CONVENIENT to be frank and honest!--This confidingness, this\ncomplaisance, this showing-the-cards of German HONESTY, is probably the\nmost dangerous and most successful disguise which the German is up to\nnowadays: it is his proper Mephistophelean art; with this he can \"still\nachieve much\"! The German lets himself go, and thereby gazes with\nfaithful, blue, empty German eyes--and other countries immediately\nconfound him with his dressing-gown!--I meant to say that, let \"German\ndepth\" be what it will--among ourselves alone we perhaps take the\nliberty to laugh at it--we shall do well to continue henceforth to\nhonour its appearance and good name, and not barter away too cheaply our\nold reputation as a people of depth for Prussian \"smartness,\" and\nBerlin wit and sand. It is wise for a people to pose, and LET itself\nbe regarded, as profound, clumsy, good-natured, honest, and foolish: it\nmight even be--profound to do so!

Ah, some time or other it will be\nover with it!--but who can doubt that it will be over still sooner with\nthe intelligence and taste for Beethoven! For he was only the last echo\nof a break and transition in style, and NOT, like Mozart, the last echo\nof a great European taste which had existed for centuries. Beethoven\nis the intermediate event between an old mellow soul that is constantly\nbreaking down, and a future over-young soul that is always COMING;\nthere is spread over his music the twilight of eternal loss and eternal\nextravagant hope,--the same light in which Europe was bathed when it\ndreamed with Rousseau, when it danced round the Tree of Liberty of the\nRevolution, and finally almost fell down in adoration before Napoleon.\nBut how rapidly does THIS very sentiment now pale, how difficult\nnowadays is even the APPREHENSION of this sentiment, how strangely does\nthe language of Rousseau, Schiller, Shelley, and Byron sound to our ear,\nin whom COLLECTIVELY the same fate of Europe was able to SPEAK, which\nknew how to SING in Beethoven!--Whatever German music came afterwards,\nbelongs to Romanticism, that is to say, to a movement which,\nhistorically considered, was still shorter, more fleeting, and more\nsuperficial than that great interlude, the transition of Europe from\nRousseau to Napoleon, and to the rise of democracy. Weber--but what do\nWE care nowadays for \"Freischutz\" and \"Oberon\"! Or Marschner's \"Hans\nHeiling\" and \"Vampyre\"! Or even Wagner's \"Tannhauser\"! That is extinct,\nalthough not yet forgotten music. This whole music of Romanticism,\nbesides, was not noble enough, was not musical enough, to maintain its\nposition anywhere but in the theatre and before the masses; from the\nbeginning it was second-rate music, which was little thought of by\ngenuine musicians. It was different with Felix Mendelssohn, that halcyon\nmaster, who, on account of his lighter, purer, happier soul, quickly\nacquired admiration, and was equally quickly forgotten: as the beautiful\nEPISODE of German music. But with regard to Robert Schumann, who took\nthings seriously, and has been taken seriously from the first--he\nwas the last that founded a school,--do we not now regard it as a\nsatisfaction, a relief, a deliverance, that this very Romanticism\nof Schumann's has been surmounted? Schumann, fleeing into the \"Saxon\nSwitzerland\" of his soul, with a half Werther-like, half Jean-Paul-like\nnature (assuredly not like Beethoven! assuredly not like Byron!)--his\nMANFRED music is a mistake and a misunderstanding to the extent of\ninjustice; Schumann, with his taste, which was fundamentally a PETTY\ntaste (that is to say, a dangerous propensity--doubly dangerous among\nGermans--for quiet lyricism and intoxication of the feelings), going\nconstantly apart, timidly withdrawing and retiring, a noble weakling who\nrevelled in nothing but anonymous joy and sorrow, from the beginning\na sort of girl and NOLI ME TANGERE--this Schumann was already merely a\nGERMAN event in music, and no longer a European event, as Beethoven had\nbeen, as in a still greater degree Mozart had been; with Schumann German\nmusic was threatened with its greatest danger, that of LOSING THE VOICE\nFOR THE SOUL OF EUROPE and sinking into a merely national affair.\n"}

After all, one just \"has no ear for it\";\nand so the most marked contrasts of style are not heard, and the most\ndelicate artistry is as it were SQUANDERED on the deaf.--These were my\nthoughts when I noticed how clumsily and unintuitively two masters in\nthe art of prose-writing have been confounded: one, whose words drop\ndown hesitatingly and coldly, as from the roof of a damp cave--he counts\non their dull sound and echo; and another who manipulates his language\nlike a flexible sword, and from his arm down into his toes feels the\ndangerous bliss of the quivering, over-sharp blade, which wishes to\nbite, hiss, and cut.\n"}

The German does not read aloud, he does not read for the\near, but only with his eyes; he has put his ears away in the drawer for\nthe time. In antiquity when a man read--which was seldom enough--he read\nsomething to himself, and in a loud voice; they were surprised when\nany one read silently, and sought secretly the reason of it. In a\nloud voice: that is to say, with all the swellings, inflections, and\nvariations of key and changes of TEMPO, in which the ancient PUBLIC\nworld took delight. The laws of the written style were then the same\nas those of the spoken style; and these laws depended partly on the\nsurprising development and refined requirements of the ear and larynx;\npartly on the strength, endurance, and power of the ancient lungs. In\nthe ancient sense, a period is above all a physiological whole, inasmuch\nas it is comprised in one breath. Such periods as occur in Demosthenes\nand Cicero, swelling twice and sinking twice, and all in one breath,\nwere pleasures to the men of ANTIQUITY, who knew by their own schooling\nhow to appreciate the virtue therein, the rareness and the difficulty\nin the deliverance of such a period;--WE have really no right to the\nBIG period, we modern men, who are short of breath in every sense! Those\nancients, indeed, were all of them dilettanti in speaking, consequently\nconnoisseurs, consequently critics--they thus brought their orators to\nthe highest pitch; in the same manner as in the last century, when all\nItalian ladies and gentlemen knew how to sing, the virtuosoship of song\n(and with it also the art of melody) reached its elevation. In Germany,\nhowever (until quite recently when a kind of platform eloquence began\nshyly and awkwardly enough to flutter its young wings), there was\nproperly speaking only one kind of public and APPROXIMATELY artistical\ndiscourse--that delivered from the pulpit. The preacher was the only one\nin Germany who knew the weight of a syllable or a word, in what manner a\nsentence strikes, springs, rushes, flows, and comes to a close; he alone\nhad a conscience in his ears, often enough a bad conscience: for reasons\nare not lacking why proficiency in oratory should be especially seldom\nattained by a German, or almost always too late. The masterpiece of\nGerman prose is therefore with good reason the masterpiece of its\ngreatest preacher: the BIBLE has hitherto been the best German\nbook.

About the Jews, for instance, listen\nto the following:--I have never yet met a German who was favourably\ninclined to the Jews; and however decided the repudiation of actual\nanti-Semitism may be on the part of all prudent and political men, this\nprudence and policy is not perhaps directed against the nature of the\nsentiment itself, but only against its dangerous excess, and especially\nagainst the distasteful and infamous expression of this excess of\nsentiment;--on this point we must not deceive ourselves. That Germany\nhas amply SUFFICIENT Jews, that the German stomach, the German blood,\nhas difficulty (and will long have difficulty) in disposing only of this\nquantity of \"Jew\"--as the Italian, the Frenchman, and the Englishman\nhave done by means of a stronger digestion:--that is the unmistakable\ndeclaration and language of a general instinct, to which one must listen\nand according to which one must act. \"Let no more Jews come in! And shut\nthe doors, especially towards the East (also towards Austria)!\"--thus\ncommands the instinct of a people whose nature is still feeble and\nuncertain, so that it could be easily wiped out, easily extinguished, by\na stronger race. The Jews, however, are beyond all doubt the strongest,\ntoughest, and purest race at present living in Europe, they know how\nto succeed even under the worst conditions (in fact better than under\nfavourable ones), by means of virtues of some sort, which one would like\nnowadays to label as vices--owing above all to a resolute faith which\ndoes not need to be ashamed before \"modern ideas\", they alter only,\nWHEN they do alter, in the same way that the Russian Empire makes\nits conquest--as an empire that has plenty of time and is not of\nyesterday--namely, according to the principle, \"as slowly as possible\"!\nA thinker who has the future of Europe at heart, will, in all his\nperspectives concerning the future, calculate upon the Jews, as he\nwill calculate upon the Russians, as above all the surest and likeliest\nfactors in the great play and battle of forces. That which is at present\ncalled a \"nation\" in Europe, and is really rather a RES FACTA than NATA\n(indeed, sometimes confusingly similar to a RES FICTA ET PICTA), is in\nevery case something evolving, young, easily displaced, and not yet\na race, much less such a race AERE PERENNUS, as the Jews are such\n\"nations\" should most carefully avoid all hot-headed rivalry and\nhostility!

Meanwhile, they\nrather wish and desire, even somewhat importunely, to be insorbed and\nabsorbed by Europe, they long to be finally settled, authorized, and\nrespected somewhere, and wish to put an end to the nomadic life, to the\n\"wandering Jew\",--and one should certainly take account of this impulse\nand tendency, and MAKE ADVANCES to it (it possibly betokens a mitigation\nof the Jewish instincts) for which purpose it would perhaps be useful\nand fair to banish the anti-Semitic bawlers out of the country.

There are, however, three things which the\nFrench can still boast of with pride as their heritage and possession,\nand as indelible tokens of their ancient intellectual superiority\nin Europe, in spite of all voluntary or involuntary Germanizing and\nvulgarizing of taste. FIRSTLY, the capacity for artistic emotion, for\ndevotion to \"form,\" for which the expression, L'ART POUR L'ART, along\nwith numerous others, has been invented:--such capacity has not been\nlacking in France for three centuries; and owing to its reverence for\nthe \"small number,\" it has again and again made a sort of chamber\nmusic of literature possible, which is sought for in vain elsewhere\nin Europe.--The SECOND thing whereby the French can lay claim to\na superiority over Europe is their ancient, many-sided, MORALISTIC\nculture, owing to which one finds on an average, even in the petty\nROMANCIERS of the newspapers and chance BOULEVARDIERS DE PARIS, a\npsychological sensitiveness and curiosity, of which, for example, one\nhas no conception (to say nothing of the thing itself!) in Germany.\nThe Germans lack a couple of centuries of the moralistic work requisite\nthereto, which, as we have said, France has not grudged: those who call\nthe Germans \"naive\" on that account give them commendation for a defect.\n(As the opposite of the German inexperience and innocence IN VOLUPTATE\nPSYCHOLOGICA, which is not too remotely associated with the tediousness\nof German intercourse,--and as the most successful expression of\ngenuine French curiosity and inventive talent in this domain of delicate\nthrills, Henri Beyle may be noted; that remarkable anticipatory and\nforerunning man, who, with a Napoleonic TEMPO, traversed HIS Europe,\nin fact, several centuries of the European soul, as a surveyor and\ndiscoverer thereof:--it has required two generations to OVERTAKE him\none way or other, to divine long afterwards some of the riddles\nthat perplexed and enraptured him--this strange Epicurean and man of\ninterrogation, the last great psychologist of France).--There is yet\na THIRD claim to superiority: in the French character there is a\nsuccessful half-way synthesis of the North and South, which makes them\ncomprehend many things, and enjoins upon them other things, which an\nEnglishman can never comprehend. Their temperament, turned alternately\nto and from the South, in which from time to time the Provencal and\nLigurian blood froths over, preserves them from the dreadful, northern\ngrey-in-grey, from sunless conceptual-spectrism and from poverty of\nblood--our GERMAN infirmity of taste, for the excessive prevalence\nof which at the present moment, blood and iron, that is to say \"high\npolitics,\" has with great resolution been prescribed (according to\na dangerous healing art, which bids me wait and wait, but not yet\nhope).--There is also still in France a pre-understanding and\nready welcome for those rarer and rarely gratified men, who are too\ncomprehensive to find satisfaction in any kind of fatherlandism, and\nknow how to love the South when in the North and the North when in the\nSouth--the born Midlanders, the \"good Europeans.\" For them BIZET\nhas made music, this latest genius, who has seen a new beauty and\nseduction,--who has discovered a piece of the SOUTH IN MUSIC.\n"}

On a more subtle comparison it will perhaps be\nfound, to the honour of Richard Wagner's German nature, that he has\nacted in everything with more strength, daring, severity, and elevation\nthan a nineteenth-century Frenchman could have done--owing to the\ncircumstance that we Germans are as yet nearer to barbarism than the\nFrench;--perhaps even the most remarkable creation of Richard Wagner is\nnot only at present, but for ever inaccessible, incomprehensible, and\ninimitable to the whole latter-day Latin race: the figure of Siegfried,\nthat VERY FREE man, who is probably far too free, too hard, too\ncheerful, too healthy, too ANTI-CATHOLIC for the taste of old and mellow\ncivilized nations.

Even the\norganization within which, as was previously supposed, the\nindividuals treat each other as equal--it takes place in every\nhealthy aristocracy--must itself, if it be a living and not a dying\norganization, do all that towards other bodies, which the individuals\nwithin it refrain from doing to each other it will have to be the\nincarnated Will to Power, it will endeavour to grow, to gain ground,\nattract to itself and acquire ascendancy--not owing to any morality or\nimmorality, but because it LIVES, and because life IS precisely Will to\nPower. On no point, however, is the ordinary consciousness of Europeans\nmore unwilling to be corrected than on this matter, people now rave\neverywhere, even under the guise of science, about coming conditions of\nsociety in which \"the exploiting character\" is to be absent--that sounds\nto my ears as if they promised to invent a mode of life which should\nrefrain from all organic functions. \"Exploitation\" does not belong to a\ndepraved, or imperfect and primitive society it belongs to the nature of\nthe living being as a primary organic function, it is a consequence\nof the intrinsic Will to Power, which is precisely the Will to\nLife--Granting that as a theory this is a novelty--as a reality it is\nthe FUNDAMENTAL FACT of all history let us be so far honest towards\nourselves!\n"}
{"body": "260. In a tour through the many finer and coarser moralities which have\nhitherto prevailed or still prevail on the earth, I found certain traits\nrecurring regularly together, and connected with one another, until\nfinally two primary types revealed themselves to me, and a radical\ndistinction was brought to light. There is MASTER-MORALITY and\nSLAVE-MORALITY,--I would at once add, however, that in all higher and\nmixed civilizations, there are also attempts at the reconciliation of\nthe two moralities, but one finds still oftener the confusion and\nmutual misunderstanding of them, indeed sometimes their close\njuxtaposition--even in the same man, within one soul. The distinctions\nof moral values have either originated in a ruling caste, pleasantly\nconscious of being different from the ruled--or among the ruled class,\nthe slaves and dependents of all sorts. In the first case, when it is\nthe rulers who determine the conception \"good,\" it is the exalted, proud\ndisposition which is regarded as the distinguishing feature, and that\nwhich determines the order of rank. The noble type of man separates\nfrom himself the beings in whom the opposite of this exalted, proud\ndisposition displays itself he despises them. Let it at once be noted\nthat in this first kind of morality the antithesis \"good\" and \"bad\"\nmeans practically the same as \"noble\" and \"despicable\",--the antithesis\n\"good\" and \"EVIL\" is of a different origin. The cowardly, the timid, the\ninsignificant, and those thinking merely of narrow utility are despised;\nmoreover, also, the distrustful, with their constrained glances, the\nself-abasing, the dog-like kind of men who let themselves be abused,\nthe mendicant flatterers, and above all the liars:--it is a fundamental\nbelief of all aristocrats that the common people are untruthful. \"We\ntruthful ones\"--the nobility in ancient Greece called themselves. It is\nobvious that everywhere the designations of moral value were at first\napplied to MEN; and were only derivatively and at a later period applied\nto ACTIONS; it is a gross mistake, therefore, when historians of morals\nstart with questions like, \"Why have sympathetic actions been praised?\"\nThe noble type of man regards HIMSELF as a determiner of values; he\ndoes not require to be approved of; he passes the judgment: \"What is\ninjurious to me is injurious in itself;\" he knows that it is he himself\nonly who confers honour on things; he is a CREATOR OF VALUES. He\nhonours whatever he recognizes in himself: such morality equals\nself-glorification. In the foreground there is the feeling of plenitude,\nof power, which seeks to overflow, the happiness of high tension, the\nconsciousness of a wealth which would fain give and bestow:--the noble\nman also helps the unfortunate, but not--or scarcely--out of pity, but\nrather from an impulse generated by the super-abundance of power. The\nnoble man honours in himself the powerful one, him also who has power\nover himself, who knows how to speak and how to keep silence, who\ntakes pleasure in subjecting himself to severity and hardness, and has\nreverence for all that is severe and hard. \"Wotan placed a hard heart in\nmy breast,\" says an old Scandinavian Saga: it is thus rightly expressed\nfrom the soul of a proud Viking. Such a type of man is even proud of not\nbeing made for sympathy; the hero of the Saga therefore adds warningly:\n\"He who has not a hard heart when young, will never have one.\" The noble\nand brave who think thus are the furthest removed from the morality\nwhich sees precisely in sympathy, or in acting for the good of others,\nor in DESINTERESSEMENT, the characteristic of the moral; faith\nin oneself, pride in oneself, a radical enmity and irony towards\n\"selflessness,\" belong as definitely to noble morality, as do a careless\nscorn and precaution in presence of sympathy and the \"warm heart.\"--It\nis the powerful who KNOW how to honour, it is their art, their domain\nfor invention. The profound reverence for age and for tradition--all law\nrests on this double reverence,--the belief and prejudice in favour of\nancestors and unfavourable to newcomers, is typical in the morality of\nthe powerful; and if, reversely, men of \"modern ideas\" believe almost\ninstinctively in \"progress\" and the \"future,\" and are more and more\nlacking in respect for old age, the ignoble origin of these \"ideas\" has\ncomplacently betrayed itself thereby. A morality of the ruling class,\nhowever, is more especially foreign and irritating to present-day taste\nin the sternness of its principle that one has duties only to one's\nequals; that one may act towards beings of a lower rank, towards all\nthat is foreign, just as seems good to one, or \"as the heart desires,\"\nand in any case \"beyond good and evil\": it is here that sympathy and\nsimilar sentiments can have a place. The ability and obligation to\nexercise prolonged gratitude and prolonged revenge--both only within the\ncircle of equals,--artfulness in retaliation, RAFFINEMENT of the idea\nin friendship, a certain necessity to have enemies (as outlets for the\nemotions of envy, quarrelsomeness, arrogance--in fact, in order to be\na good FRIEND): all these are typical characteristics of the noble\nmorality, which, as has been pointed out, is not the morality of \"modern\nideas,\" and is therefore at present difficult to realize, and also to\nunearth and disclose.--It is otherwise with the second type of morality,\nSLAVE-MORALITY. Supposing that the abused, the oppressed, the suffering,\nthe unemancipated, the weary, and those uncertain of themselves should\nmoralize, what will be the common element in their moral estimates?\nProbably a pessimistic suspicion with regard to the entire situation of\nman will find expression, perhaps a condemnation of man, together with\nhis situation. The slave has an unfavourable eye for the virtues of the\npowerful; he has a skepticism and distrust, a REFINEMENT of distrust of\neverything \"good\" that is there honoured--he would fain persuade himself\nthat the very happiness there is not genuine. On the other hand, THOSE\nqualities which serve to alleviate the existence of sufferers are\nbrought into prominence and flooded with light; it is here that\nsympathy, the kind, helping hand, the warm heart, patience, diligence,\nhumility, and friendliness attain to honour; for here these are the most\nuseful qualities, and almost the only means of supporting the burden of\nexistence. Slave-morality is essentially the morality of utility.\nHere is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis \"good\" and\n\"evil\":--power and dangerousness are assumed to reside in the evil,\na certain dreadfulness, subtlety, and strength, which do not admit of\nbeing despised. According to slave-morality, therefore, the \"evil\" man\narouses fear; according to master-morality, it is precisely the \"good\"\nman who arouses fear and seeks to arouse it, while the bad man is\nregarded as the despicable being. The contrast attains its maximum when,\nin accordance with the logical consequences of slave-morality, a shade\nof depreciation--it may be slight and well-intentioned--at last attaches\nitself to the \"good\" man of this morality; because, according to the\nservile mode of thought, the good man must in any case be the SAFE\nman: he is good-natured, easily deceived, perhaps a little stupid, un\nbonhomme. Everywhere that slave-morality gains the ascendancy, language\nshows a tendency to approximate the significations of the words \"good\"\nand \"stupid.\"--A last fundamental difference: the desire for FREEDOM,\nthe instinct for happiness and the refinements of the feeling of liberty\nbelong as necessarily to slave-morals and morality, as artifice and\nenthusiasm in reverence and devotion are the regular symptoms of an\naristocratic mode of thinking and estimating.--Hence we can understand\nwithout further detail why love AS A PASSION--it is our European\nspecialty--must absolutely be of noble origin; as is well known, its\ninvention is due to the Provencal poet-cavaliers, those brilliant,\ningenious men of the \"gai saber,\" to whom Europe owes so much, and\nalmost owes itself.\n"}
{"body": "261. Vanity is one of the things which are perhaps most difficult for\na noble man to understand: he will be tempted to deny it, where another\nkind of man thinks he sees it self-evidently. The problem for him is\nto represent to his mind beings who seek to arouse a good opinion of\nthemselves which they themselves do not possess--and consequently also\ndo not \"deserve,\"--and who yet BELIEVE in this good opinion\nafterwards. This seems to him on the one hand such bad taste and so\nself-disrespectful, and on the other hand so grotesquely unreasonable,\nthat he would like to consider vanity an exception, and is doubtful\nabout it in most cases when it is spoken of. He will say, for\ninstance: \"I may be mistaken about my value, and on the other hand\nmay nevertheless demand that my value should be acknowledged by others\nprecisely as I rate it:--that, however, is not vanity (but self-conceit,\nor, in most cases, that which is called 'humility,' and also\n'modesty').\" Or he will even say: \"For many reasons I can delight in\nthe good opinion of others, perhaps because I love and honour them,\nand rejoice in all their joys, perhaps also because their good opinion\nendorses and strengthens my belief in my own good opinion, perhaps\nbecause the good opinion of others, even in cases where I do not share\nit, is useful to me, or gives promise of usefulness:--all this, however,\nis not vanity.\" The man of noble character must first bring it home\nforcibly to his mind, especially with the aid of history, that, from\ntime immemorial, in all social strata in any way dependent, the ordinary\nman WAS only that which he PASSED FOR:--not being at all accustomed to\nfix values, he did not assign even to himself any other value than that\nwhich his master assigned to him (it is the peculiar RIGHT OF MASTERS to\ncreate values). It may be looked upon as the result of an extraordinary\natavism, that the ordinary man, even at present, is still always WAITING\nfor an opinion about himself, and then instinctively submitting himself\nto it; yet by no means only to a \"good\" opinion, but also to a bad\nand unjust one (think, for instance, of the greater part of the\nself-appreciations and self-depreciations which believing women learn\nfrom their confessors, and which in general the believing Christian\nlearns from his Church). In fact, conformably to the slow rise of the\ndemocratic social order (and its cause, the blending of the blood\nof masters and slaves), the originally noble and rare impulse of\nthe masters to assign a value to themselves and to \"think well\" of\nthemselves, will now be more and more encouraged and extended; but\nit has at all times an older, ampler, and more radically ingrained\npropensity opposed to it--and in the phenomenon of \"vanity\" this older\npropensity overmasters the younger. The vain person rejoices over EVERY\ngood opinion which he hears about himself (quite apart from the point\nof view of its usefulness, and equally regardless of its truth or\nfalsehood), just as he suffers from every bad opinion: for he subjects\nhimself to both, he feels himself subjected to both, by that oldest\ninstinct of subjection which breaks forth in him.--It is \"the slave\"\nin the vain man's blood, the remains of the slave's craftiness--and how\nmuch of the \"slave\" is still left in woman, for instance!--which\nseeks to SEDUCE to good opinions of itself; it is the slave, too, who\nimmediately afterwards falls prostrate himself before these opinions, as\nthough he had not called them forth.--And to repeat it again: vanity is\nan atavism.\n"}
{"body": "262. A SPECIES originates, and a type becomes established and strong in\nthe long struggle with essentially constant UNFAVOURABLE conditions. On\nthe other hand, it is known by the experience of breeders that species\nwhich receive super-abundant nourishment, and in general a surplus of\nprotection and care, immediately tend in the most marked way to develop\nvariations, and are fertile in prodigies and monstrosities (also in\nmonstrous vices). Now look at an aristocratic commonwealth, say\nan ancient Greek polis, or Venice, as a voluntary or involuntary\ncontrivance for the purpose of REARING human beings; there are there men\nbeside one another, thrown upon their own resources, who want to make\ntheir species prevail, chiefly because they MUST prevail, or else\nrun the terrible danger of being exterminated. The favour, the\nsuper-abundance, the protection are there lacking under which variations\nare fostered; the species needs itself as species, as something which,\nprecisely by virtue of its hardness, its uniformity, and simplicity of\nstructure, can in general prevail and make itself permanent in\nconstant struggle with its neighbours, or with rebellious or\nrebellion-threatening vassals. The most varied experience teaches it\nwhat are the qualities to which it principally owes the fact that\nit still exists, in spite of all Gods and men, and has hitherto been\nvictorious: these qualities it calls virtues, and these virtues alone\nit develops to maturity. It does so with severity, indeed it desires\nseverity; every aristocratic morality is intolerant in the education\nof youth, in the control of women, in the marriage customs, in the\nrelations of old and young, in the penal laws (which have an eye only\nfor the degenerating): it counts intolerance itself among the virtues,\nunder the name of \"justice.\" A type with few, but very marked features,\na species of severe, warlike, wisely silent, reserved, and reticent\nmen (and as such, with the most delicate sensibility for the charm and\nnuances of society) is thus established, unaffected by the vicissitudes\nof generations; the constant struggle with uniform UNFAVOURABLE\nconditions is, as already remarked, the cause of a type becoming\nstable and hard. Finally, however, a happy state of things results, the\nenormous tension is relaxed; there are perhaps no more enemies among the\nneighbouring peoples, and the means of life, even of the enjoyment\nof life, are present in superabundance. With one stroke the bond and\nconstraint of the old discipline severs: it is no longer regarded as\nnecessary, as a condition of existence--if it would continue, it can\nonly do so as a form of LUXURY, as an archaizing TASTE. Variations,\nwhether they be deviations (into the higher, finer, and rarer), or\ndeteriorations and monstrosities, appear suddenly on the scene in the\ngreatest exuberance and splendour; the individual dares to be individual\nand detach himself. At this turning-point of history there manifest\nthemselves, side by side, and often mixed and entangled together, a\nmagnificent, manifold, virgin-forest-like up-growth and up-striving, a\nkind of TROPICAL TEMPO in the rivalry of growth, and an extraordinary\ndecay and self-destruction, owing to the savagely opposing and seemingly\nexploding egoisms, which strive with one another \"for sun and light,\"\nand can no longer assign any limit, restraint, or forbearance for\nthemselves by means of the hitherto existing morality. It was this\nmorality itself which piled up the strength so enormously, which bent\nthe bow in so threatening a manner:--it is now \"out of date,\" it is\ngetting \"out of date.\" The dangerous and disquieting point has been\nreached when the greater, more manifold, more comprehensive life IS\nLIVED BEYOND the old morality; the \"individual\" stands out, and is\nobliged to have recourse to his own law-giving, his own arts and\nartifices for self-preservation, self-elevation, and self-deliverance.\nNothing but new \"Whys,\" nothing but new \"Hows,\" no common formulas any\nlonger, misunderstanding and disregard in league with each other, decay,\ndeterioration, and the loftiest desires frightfully entangled, the\ngenius of the race overflowing from all the cornucopias of good and bad,\na portentous simultaneousness of Spring and Autumn, full of new charms\nand mysteries peculiar to the fresh, still inexhausted, still unwearied\ncorruption. Danger is again present, the mother of morality, great\ndanger; this time shifted into the individual, into the neighbour and\nfriend, into the street, into their own child, into their own heart,\ninto all the most personal and secret recesses of their desires and\nvolitions. What will the moral philosophers who appear at this time have\nto preach? They discover, these sharp onlookers and loafers, that the\nend is quickly approaching, that everything around them decays and\nproduces decay, that nothing will endure until the day after tomorrow,\nexcept one species of man, the incurably MEDIOCRE. The mediocre alone\nhave a prospect of continuing and propagating themselves--they will\nbe the men of the future, the sole survivors; \"be like them! become\nmediocre!\" is now the only morality which has still a significance,\nwhich still obtains a hearing.--But it is difficult to preach this\nmorality of mediocrity! it can never avow what it is and what it\ndesires! it has to talk of moderation and dignity and duty and brotherly\nlove--it will have difficulty IN CONCEALING ITS IRONY!\n"}

At the risk of displeasing innocent ears, I submit that egoism\nbelongs to the essence of a noble soul, I mean the unalterable belief\nthat to a being such as \"we,\" other beings must naturally be in\nsubjection, and have to sacrifice themselves. The noble soul accepts the\nfact of his egoism without question, and also without consciousness of\nharshness, constraint, or arbitrariness therein, but rather as something\nthat may have its basis in the primary law of things:--if he sought a\ndesignation for it he would say: \"It is justice itself.\" He acknowledges\nunder certain circumstances, which made him hesitate at first, that\nthere are other equally privileged ones; as soon as he has settled this\nquestion of rank, he moves among those equals and equally privileged\nones with the same assurance, as regards modesty and delicate respect,\nwhich he enjoys in intercourse with himself--in accordance with an\ninnate heavenly mechanism which all the stars understand.

What, after all, is ignobleness?--Words are vocal symbols for\nideas; ideas, however, are more or less definite mental symbols\nfor frequently returning and concurring sensations, for groups of\nsensations. It is not sufficient to use the same words in order to\nunderstand one another: we must also employ the same words for the same\nkind of internal experiences, we must in the end have experiences IN\nCOMMON. On this account the people of one nation understand one another\nbetter than those belonging to different nations, even when they use\nthe same language; or rather, when people have lived long together under\nsimilar conditions (of climate, soil, danger, requirement, toil) there\nORIGINATES therefrom an entity that \"understands itself\"--namely, a\nnation. In all souls a like number of frequently recurring experiences\nhave gained the upper hand over those occurring more rarely: about\nthese matters people understand one another rapidly and always more\nrapidly--the history of language is the history of a process of\nabbreviation; on the basis of this quick comprehension people always\nunite closer and closer. The greater the danger, the greater is the\nneed of agreeing quickly and readily about what is necessary; not to\nmisunderstand one another in danger--that is what cannot at all be\ndispensed with in intercourse. Also in all loves and friendships one has\nthe experience that nothing of the kind continues when the discovery\nhas been made that in using the same words, one of the two parties has\nfeelings, thoughts, intuitions, wishes, or fears different from those of\nthe other.

One may perceive\nin almost every psychologist a tell-tale inclination for delightful\nintercourse with commonplace and well-ordered men; the fact is thereby\ndisclosed that he always requires healing, that he needs a sort\nof flight and forgetfulness, away from what his insight and\nincisiveness--from what his \"business\"--has laid upon his conscience.\nThe fear of his memory is peculiar to him.

Alas, he who knows the heart finds out how poor,\nhelpless, pretentious, and blundering even the best and deepest love\nis--he finds that it rather DESTROYS than saves!--It is possible that\nunder the holy fable and travesty of the life of Jesus there is hidden\none of the most painful cases of the martyrdom of KNOWLEDGE ABOUT LOVE:\nthe martyrdom of the most innocent and most craving heart, that\nnever had enough of any human love, that DEMANDED love, that demanded\ninexorably and frantically to be loved and nothing else, with terrible\noutbursts against those who refused him their love; the story of a poor\nsoul insatiated and insatiable in love, that had to invent hell to send\nthither those who WOULD NOT love him--and that at last, enlightened\nabout human love, had to invent a God who is entire love, entire\nCAPACITY for love--who takes pity on human love, because it is so\npaltry, so ignorant! He who has such sentiments, he who has such\nKNOWLEDGE about love--SEEKS for death!--But why should one deal with\nsuch painful matters? Provided, of course, that one is not obliged to do\nso.\n"}

Profound suffering makes noble:\nit separates.--One of the most refined forms of disguise is Epicurism,\nalong with a certain ostentatious boldness of taste, which takes\nsuffering lightly, and puts itself on the defensive against all that\nis sorrowful and profound. They are \"gay men\" who make use of gaiety,\nbecause they are misunderstood on account of it--they WISH to be\nmisunderstood. There are \"scientific minds\" who make use of science,\nbecause it gives a gay appearance, and because scientificness leads to\nthe conclusion that a person is superficial--they WISH to mislead to a\nfalse conclusion. There are free insolent minds which would fain conceal\nand deny that they are broken, proud, incurable hearts (the cynicism of\nHamlet--the case of Galiani); and occasionally folly itself is the mask\nof an unfortunate OVER-ASSURED knowledge.--From which it follows that it\nis the part of a more refined humanity to have reverence \"for the mask,\"\nand not to make use of psychology and curiosity in the wrong place.\n"}

Any\nkind of cognizance of an indescribable excess in the joy of the bath,\nany kind of ardour or thirst which perpetually impels the soul out\nof night into the morning, and out of gloom, out of \"affliction\" into\nclearness, brightness, depth, and refinement:--just as much as such a\ntendency DISTINGUISHES--it is a noble tendency--it also SEPARATES.--The\npity of the saint is pity for the FILTH of the human, all-too-human.\nAnd there are grades and heights where pity itself is regarded by him as\nimpurity, as filth.\n"}

In the writings of a recluse one always hears something of the echo\nof the wilderness, something of the murmuring tones and timid vigilance\nof solitude; in his strongest words, even in his cry itself, there\nsounds a new and more dangerous kind of silence, of concealment. He who\nhas sat day and night, from year's end to year's end, alone with his\nsoul in familiar discord and discourse, he who has become a cave-bear,\nor a treasure-seeker, or a treasure-guardian and dragon in his cave--it\nmay be a labyrinth, but can also be a gold-mine--his ideas themselves\neventually acquire a twilight-colour of their own, and an odour, as much\nof the depth as of the mould, something uncommunicative and repulsive,\nwhich blows chilly upon every passer-by. The recluse does not believe\nthat a philosopher--supposing that a philosopher has always in the first\nplace been a recluse--ever expressed his actual and ultimate opinions in\nbooks: are not books written precisely to hide what is in us?--indeed,\nhe will doubt whether a philosopher CAN have \"ultimate and actual\"\nopinions at all; whether behind every cave in him there is not, and must\nnecessarily be, a still deeper cave: an ampler, stranger, richer\nworld beyond the surface, an abyss behind every bottom, beneath every\n\"foundation.\" Every philosophy is a foreground philosophy--this is a\nrecluse's verdict: \"There is something arbitrary in the fact that the\nPHILOSOPHER came to a stand here, took a retrospect, and looked around;\nthat he HERE laid his spade aside and did not dig any deeper--there\nis also something suspicious in it.\" Every philosophy also CONCEALS a\nphilosophy; every opinion is also a LURKING-PLACE, every word is also a\nMASK.\n"}

Unless it be that you\nhave already divined of your own accord who this questionable God\nand spirit is, that wishes to be PRAISED in such a manner? For, as it\nhappens to every one who from childhood onward has always been on his\nlegs, and in foreign lands, I have also encountered on my path many\nstrange and dangerous spirits; above all, however, and again and again,\nthe one of whom I have just spoken: in fact, no less a personage than\nthe God DIONYSUS, the great equivocator and tempter, to whom, as you\nknow, I once offered in all secrecy and reverence my first-fruits--the\nlast, as it seems to me, who has offered a SACRIFICE to him, for I\nhave found no one who could understand what I was then doing. In\nthe meantime, however, I have learned much, far too much, about the\nphilosophy of this God, and, as I said, from mouth to mouth--I, the last\ndisciple and initiate of the God Dionysus: and perhaps I might at last\nbegin to give you, my friends, as far as I am allowed, a little taste of\nthis philosophy? In a hushed voice, as is but seemly: for it has to do\nwith much that is secret, new, strange, wonderful, and uncanny. The\nvery fact that Dionysus is a philosopher, and that therefore Gods also\nphilosophize, seems to me a novelty which is not unensnaring, and might\nperhaps arouse suspicion precisely among philosophers;--among you, my\nfriends, there is less to be said against it, except that it comes too\nlate and not at the right time; for, as it has been disclosed to me, you\nare loth nowadays to believe in God and gods. It may happen, too, that\nin the frankness of my story I must go further than is agreeable to the\nstrict usages of your ears? Certainly the God in question went further,\nvery much further, in such dialogues, and was always many paces ahead of\nme... Indeed, if it were allowed, I should have to give him, according\nto human usage, fine ceremonious tides of lustre and merit, I should\nhave to extol his courage as investigator and discoverer, his fearless\nhonesty, truthfulness, and love of wisdom. But such a God does not know\nwhat to do with all that respectable trumpery and pomp. \"Keep that,\" he\nwould say, \"for thyself and those like thee, and whoever else require\nit! I--have no reason to cover my nakedness!\" One suspects that this\nkind of divinity and philosopher perhaps lacks shame?--He once said:\n\"Under certain circumstances I love mankind\"--and referred thereby to\nAriadne, who was present; \"in my opinion man is an agreeable, brave,\ninventive animal, that has not his equal upon earth, he makes his way\neven through all labyrinths. I like man, and often think how I can\nstill further advance him, and make him stronger, more evil, and more\nprofound.\"--\"Stronger, more evil, and more profound?\" I asked in horror.\n\"Yes,\" he said again, \"stronger, more evil, and more profound; also more\nbeautiful\"--and thereby the tempter-god smiled with his halcyon smile,\nas though he had just paid some charming compliment. One here sees at\nonce that it is not only shame that this divinity lacks;--and in general\nthere are good grounds for supposing that in some things the Gods could\nall of them come to us men for instruction.

{"body": "It is often enough, and always with great surprise, intimated to me that\nthere is something both ordinary and unusual in all my writings, from\nthe \"Birth of Tragedy\" to the recently published \"Prelude to a\nPhilosophy of the Future\": they all contain, I have been told, snares\nand nets for short sighted birds, and something that is almost a\nconstant, subtle, incitement to an overturning of habitual opinions and\nof approved customs. What!? Everything is merely--human--all too human?\nWith this exclamation my writings are gone through, not without a\ncertain dread and mistrust of ethic itself and not without a disposition\nto ask the exponent of evil things if those things be not simply\nmisrepresented. My writings have been termed a school of distrust, still\nmore of disdain: also, and more happily, of courage, audacity even. And\nin fact, I myself do not believe that anybody ever looked into the world\nwith a distrust as deep as mine, seeming, as I do, not simply the timely\nadvocate of the devil, but, to employ theological terms, an enemy and\nchallenger of God; and whosoever has experienced any of the consequences\nof such deep distrust, anything of the chills and the agonies of\nisolation to which such an unqualified difference of standpoint condemns\nhim endowed with it, will also understand how often I must have sought\nrelief and self-forgetfulness from any source--through any object of\nveneration or enmity, of scientific seriousness or wanton lightness;\nalso why I, when I could not find what I was in need of, had to fashion\nit for myself, counterfeiting it or imagining it (and what poet or\nwriter has ever done anything else, and what other purpose can all the\nart in the world possibly have?) That which I always stood most in need\nof in order to effect my cure and self-recovery was faith, faith enough\nnot to be thus isolated, not to look at life from so singular a point of\nview--a magic apprehension (in eye and mind) of relationship and\nequality, a calm confidence in friendship, a blindness, free from\nsuspicion and questioning, to two sidedness; a pleasure in externals,\nsuperficialities, the near, the accessible, in all things possessed of\ncolor, skin and seeming. Perhaps I could be fairly reproached with much\n\"art\" in this regard, many fine counterfeitings; for example, that,\nwisely or wilfully, I had shut my eyes to Schopenhauer's blind will\ntowards ethic, at a time when I was already clear sighted enough on the\nsubject of ethic; likewise that I had deceived myself concerning Richard\nWagner's incurable romanticism, as if it were a beginning and not an\nend; likewise concerning the Greeks, likewise concerning the Germans and\ntheir future--and there may be, perhaps, a long list of such likewises.\nGranted, however, that all this were true, and with justice urged\nagainst me, what does it signify, what can it signify in regard to how\nmuch of the self-sustaining capacity, how much of reason and higher\nprotection are embraced in such self-deception?--and how much more\nfalsity is still necessary to me that I may therewith always reassure\nmyself regarding the luxury of my truth. Enough, I still live; and life\nis not considered now apart from ethic; it _will_ [have] deception; it\nthrives (lebt) on deception ... but am I not beginning to do all over\nagain what I have always done, I, the old immoralist, and bird\nsnarer--talk unmorally, ultramorally, \"beyond good and evil\"?\n"}

That such free\nspirits can possibly exist, that our Europe will yet number among her\nsons of to-morrow or of the day after to-morrow, such a brilliant and\nenthusiastic company, alive and palpable and not merely, as in my case,\nfantasms and imaginary shades, I, myself, can by no means doubt.

{"body": "It may be conjectured that a soul in which the type of \"free spirit\" can\nattain maturity and completeness had its decisive and deciding event in\nthe form of a great emancipation or unbinding, and that prior to that\nevent it seemed only the more firmly and forever chained to its place\nand pillar. What binds strongest? What cords seem almost unbreakable? In\nthe case of mortals of a choice and lofty nature they will be those of\nduty: that reverence, which in youth is most typical, that timidity and\ntenderness in the presence of the traditionally honored and the worthy,\nthat gratitude to the soil from which we sprung, for the hand that\nguided us, for the relic before which we were taught to pray--their\nsublimest moments will themselves bind these souls most strongly. The\ngreat liberation comes suddenly to such prisoners, like an earthquake:\nthe young soul is all at once shaken, torn apart, cast forth--it\ncomprehends not itself what is taking place. An involuntary onward\nimpulse rules them with the mastery of command; a will, a wish are\ndeveloped to go forward, anywhere, at any price; a strong, dangerous\ncuriosity regarding an undiscovered world flames and flashes in all\ntheir being. \"Better to die than live _here_\"--so sounds the tempting\nvoice: and this \"here,\" this \"at home\" constitutes all they have\nhitherto loved. A sudden dread and distrust of that which they loved, a\nflash of contempt for that which is called their \"duty,\" a mutinous,\nwilful, volcanic-like longing for a far away journey, strange scenes and\npeople, annihilation, petrifaction, a hatred surmounting love, perhaps a\nsacrilegious impulse and look backwards, to where they so long prayed\nand loved, perhaps a flush of shame for what they did and at the same\ntime an exultation at having done it, an inner, intoxicating,\ndelightful tremor in which is betrayed the sense of victory--a victory?\nover what? over whom? a riddle-like victory, fruitful in questioning and\nwell worth questioning, but the _first_ victory, for all--such things of\npain and ill belong to the history of the great liberation. And it is at\nthe same time a malady that can destroy a man, this first outbreak of\nstrength and will for self-destination, self-valuation, this will for\nfree will: and how much illness is forced to the surface in the frantic\nstrivings and singularities with which the freedman, the liberated seeks\nhenceforth to attest his mastery over things! He roves fiercely around,\nwith an unsatisfied longing and whatever objects he may encounter must\nsuffer from the perilous expectancy of his pride; he tears to pieces\nwhatever attracts him. With a sardonic laugh he overturns whatever he\nfinds veiled or protected by any reverential awe: he would see what\nthese things look like when they are overturned. It is wilfulness and\ndelight in the wilfulness of it, if he now, perhaps, gives his approval\nto that which has heretofore been in ill repute--if, in curiosity and\nexperiment, he penetrates stealthily to the most forbidden things. In\nthe background during all his plunging and roaming--for he is as\nrestless and aimless in his course as if lost in a wilderness--is the\ninterrogation mark of a curiosity growing ever more dangerous. \"Can we\nnot upset every standard? and is good perhaps evil? and God only an\ninvention and a subtlety of the devil? Is everything, in the last\nresort, false? And if we are dupes are we not on that very account\ndupers also? _must_ we not be dupers also?\" Such reflections lead and\nmislead him, ever further on, ever further away. Solitude, that dread\ngoddess and mater saeva cupidinum, encircles and besets him, ever more\nthreatening, more violent, more heart breaking--but who to-day knows\nwhat solitude is?\n"}
{"body": "From this morbid solitude, from the deserts of such trial years, the way\nis yet far to that great, overflowing certainty and healthiness which\ncannot dispense even with sickness as a means and a grappling hook of\nknowledge; to that matured freedom of the spirit which is, in an equal\ndegree, self mastery and discipline of the heart, and gives access to\nthe path of much and various reflection--to that inner comprehensiveness\nand self satisfaction of over-richness which precludes all danger that\nthe spirit has gone astray even in its own path and is sitting\nintoxicated in some corner or other; to that overplus of plastic,\nhealing, imitative and restorative power which is the very sign of\nvigorous health, that overplus which confers upon the free spirit the\nperilous prerogative of spending a life in experiment and of running\nadventurous risks: the past-master-privilege of the free spirit. In the\ninterval there may be long years of convalescence, years filled with\nmany hued painfully-bewitching transformations, dominated and led to the\ngoal by a tenacious will for health that is often emboldened to assume\nthe guise and the disguise of health. There is a middle ground to this,\nwhich a man of such destiny can not subsequently recall without emotion;\nhe basks in a special fine sun of his own, with a feeling of birdlike\nfreedom, birdlike visual power, birdlike irrepressibleness, a something\nextraneous (Drittes) in which curiosity and delicate disdain have\nunited. A \"free spirit\"--this refreshing term is grateful in any mood,\nit almost sets one aglow. One lives--no longer in the bonds of love and\nhate, without a yes or no, here or there indifferently, best pleased to\nevade, to avoid, to beat about, neither advancing nor retreating. One is\nhabituated to the bad, like a person who all at once sees a fearful\nhurly-burly _beneath_ him--and one was the counterpart of him who\nbothers himself with things that do not concern him. As a matter of fact\nthe free spirit is bothered with mere things--and how many\nthings--which no longer _concern_ him.\n"}
{"body": "A step further in recovery: and the free spirit draws near to life\nagain, slowly indeed, almost refractorily, almost distrustfully. There\nis again warmth and mellowness: feeling and fellow feeling acquire\ndepth, lambent airs stir all about him. He almost feels: it seems as if\nnow for the first time his eyes are open to things _near_. He is in\namaze and sits hushed: for where had he been? These near and immediate\nthings: how changed they seem to him! He looks gratefully back--grateful\nfor his wandering, his self exile and severity, his lookings afar and\nhis bird flights in the cold heights. How fortunate that he has not,\nlike a sensitive, dull home body, remained always \"in the house\" and \"at\nhome!\" He had been beside himself, beyond a doubt. Now for the first\ntime he really sees himself--and what surprises in the process. What\nhitherto unfelt tremors! Yet what joy in the exhaustion, the old\nsickness, the relapses of the convalescent! How it delights him,\nsuffering, to sit still, to exercise patience, to lie in the sun! Who so\nwell as he appreciates the fact that there comes balmy weather even in\nwinter, who delights more in the sunshine athwart the wall? They are\nthe most appreciative creatures in the world, and also the most humble,\nthese convalescents and lizards, crawling back towards life: there are\nsome among them who can let no day slip past them without addressing\nsome song of praise to its retreating light. And speaking seriously, it\nis a fundamental cure for all pessimism (the cankerous vice, as is well\nknown, of all idealists and humbugs), to become ill in the manner of\nthese free spirits, to remain ill quite a while and then bit by bit grow\nhealthy--I mean healthier. It is wisdom, worldly wisdom, to administer\neven health to oneself for a long time in small doses.\n"}
{"body": "About this time it becomes at last possible, amid the flash lights of a\nstill unestablished, still precarious health, for the free, the ever\nfreer spirit to begin to read the riddle of that great liberation, a\nriddle which has hitherto lingered, obscure, well worth questioning,\nalmost impalpable, in his memory. If once he hardly dared to ask \"why so\napart? so alone? renouncing all I loved? renouncing respect itself? why\nthis coldness, this suspicion, this hate for one's very virtues?\"--now\nhe dares, and asks it loudly, already hearing the answer, \"you had to\nbecome master over yourself, master of your own good qualities. Formerly\nthey were your masters: but they should be merely your tools along with\nother tools. You had to acquire power over your aye and no and learn to\nhold and withhold them in accordance with your higher aims. You had to\ngrasp the perspective of every representation (Werthsch\u00e4tzung)--the\ndislocation, distortion and the apparent end or teleology of the\nhorizon, besides whatever else appertains to the perspective: also the\nelement of demerit in its relation to opposing merit, and the whole\nintellectual cost of every affirmative, every negative. You had to find\nout the _inevitable_ error[1] in every Yes and in every No, error as\ninseparable from life, life itself as conditioned by the perspective and\nits inaccuracy.[1] Above all, you had to see with your own eyes where\nthe error[1] is always greatest: there, namely, where life is littlest,\nnarrowest, meanest, least developed and yet cannot help looking upon\nitself as the goal and standard of things, and smugly and ignobly and\nincessantly tearing to tatters all that is highest and greatest and\nrichest, and putting the shreds into the form of questions from the\nstandpoint of its own well being. You had to see with your own eyes the\nproblem of classification, (Rangordnung, regulation concerning rank and\nstation) and how strength and sweep and reach of perspective wax upward\ntogether: You had\"--enough, the free spirit knows henceforward which\n\"you had\" it has obeyed and also what it now can do and what it now, for\nthe first time, _dare_.\n"}

{"body": "Accordingly, the free spirit works out for itself an answer to that\nriddle of its liberation and concludes by generalizing upon its\nexperience in the following fashion: \"What I went through everyone must\ngo through\" in whom any problem is germinated and strives to body itself\nforth. The inner power and inevitability of this problem will assert\nthemselves in due course, as in the case of any unsuspected\npregnancy--long before the spirit has seen this problem in its true\naspect and learned to call it by its right name. Our destiny exercises\nits influence over us even when, as yet, we have not learned its nature:\nit is our future that lays down the law to our to-day.

Here, a long ladder on the rungs of which we\nourselves have rested and risen, which we have actually been at times.\nHere is a something higher, a something deeper, a something below us, a\nvastly extensive order, (Ordnung) a comparative classification\n(Rangordnung), that we perceive: here--_our_ problem!\"\n"}

{"body": "=Chemistry of the Notions and the Feelings.=--Philosophical problems, in\nalmost all their aspects, present themselves in the same interrogative\nformula now that they did two thousand years ago: how can a thing\ndevelop out of its antithesis? for example, the reasonable from the\nnon-reasonable, the animate from the inanimate, the logical from the\nillogical, altruism from egoism, disinterestedness from greed, truth\nfrom error? The metaphysical philosophy formerly steered itself clear of\nthis difficulty to such extent as to repudiate the evolution of one\nthing from another and to assign a miraculous origin to what it deemed\nhighest and best, due to the very nature and being of the\n\"thing-in-itself.\" The historical philosophy, on the other hand, which\ncan no longer be viewed apart from physical science, the youngest of all\nphilosophical methods, discovered experimentally (and its results will\nprobably always be the same) that there is no antithesis whatever,\nexcept in the usual exaggerations of popular or metaphysical\ncomprehension, and that an error of the reason is at the bottom of such\ncontradiction. According to its explanation, there is, strictly\nspeaking, neither unselfish conduct, nor a wholly disinterested point of\nview. Both are simply sublimations in which the basic element seems\nalmost evaporated and betrays its presence only to the keenest\nobservation. All that we need and that could possibly be given us in the\npresent state of development of the sciences, is a chemistry of the\nmoral, religious, aesthetic conceptions and feeling, as well as of those\nemotions which we experience in the affairs, great and small, of society\nand civilization, and which we are sensible of even in solitude. But\nwhat if this chemistry established the fact that, even in _its_ domain,\nthe most magnificent results were attained with the basest and most\ndespised ingredients? Would many feel disposed to continue such\ninvestigations? Mankind loves to put by the questions of its origin and\nbeginning: must one not be almost inhuman in order to follow the\nopposite course?\n"}
{"body": "=The Traditional Error of Philosophers.=--All philosophers make the\ncommon mistake of taking contemporary man as their starting point and of\ntrying, through an analysis of him, to reach a conclusion. \"Man\"\ninvoluntarily presents himself to them as an aeterna veritas as a\npassive element in every hurly-burly, as a fixed standard of things. Yet\neverything uttered by the philosopher on the subject of man is, in the\nlast resort, nothing more than a piece of testimony concerning man\nduring a very limited period of time. Lack of the historical sense is\nthe traditional defect in all philosophers. Many innocently take man in\nhis most childish state as fashioned through the influence of certain\nreligious and even of certain political developments, as the permanent\nform under which man must be viewed. They will not learn that man has\nevolved,[4] that the intellectual faculty itself is an evolution,\nwhereas some philosophers make the whole cosmos out of this intellectual\nfaculty. But everything essential in human evolution took place aeons\nago, long before the four thousand years or so of which we know\nanything: during these man may not have changed very much. However, the\nphilosopher ascribes \"instinct\" to contemporary man and assumes that\nthis is one of the unalterable facts regarding man himself, and hence\naffords a clue to the understanding of the universe in general. The\nwhole teleology is so planned that man during the last four thousand\nyears shall be spoken of as a being existing from all eternity, and\nwith reference to whom everything in the cosmos from its very inception\nis naturally ordered. Yet everything evolved: there are no eternal facts\nas there are no absolute truths. Accordingly, historical philosophising\nis henceforth indispensable, and with it honesty of judgment.\n"}
{"body": "[4] geworden.\n"}
{"body": "=Appreciation of Simple Truths.=--It is the characteristic of an\nadvanced civilization to set a higher value upon little, simple truths,\nascertained by scientific method, than upon the pleasing and magnificent\nerrors originating in metaphysical and \u00e6sthetical epochs and peoples. To\nbegin with, the former are spoken of with contempt as if there could be\nno question of comparison respecting them, so rigid, homely, prosaic and\neven discouraging is the aspect of the first, while so beautiful,\ndecorative, intoxicating and perhaps beatific appear the last named.\nNevertheless, the hardwon, the certain, the lasting and, therefore, the\nfertile in new knowledge, is the higher; to hold fast to it is manly and\nevinces courage, directness, endurance. And not only individual men but\nall mankind will by degrees be uplifted to this manliness when they are\nfinally habituated to the proper appreciation of tenable, enduring\nknowledge and have lost all faith in inspiration and in the miraculous\nrevelation of truth. The reverers of forms, indeed, with their standards\nof beauty and taste, may have good reason to laugh when the appreciation\nof little truths and the scientific spirit begin to prevail, but that\nwill be only because their eyes are not yet opened to the charm of the\nutmost simplicity of form or because men though reared in the rightly\nappreciative spirit, will still not be fully permeated by it, so that\nthey continue unwittingly imitating ancient forms (and that ill enough,\nas anybody does who no longer feels any interest in a thing). Formerly\nthe mind was not brought into play through the medium of exact thought.\nIts serious business lay in the working out of forms and symbols. That\nhas now changed. Any seriousness in symbolism is at present the\nindication of a deficient education. As our very acts become more\nintellectual, our tendencies more rational, and our judgment, for\nexample, as to what seems reasonable, is very different from what it was\na hundred years ago: so the forms of our lives grow ever more\nintellectual and, to the old fashioned eye, perhaps, uglier, but only\nbecause it cannot see that the richness of inner, rational beauty always\nspreads and deepens, and that the inner, rational aspect of all things\nshould now be of more consequence to us than the most beautiful\nexternality and the most exquisite limning.\n"}
{"body": "=Astrology and the Like.=--It is presumable that the objects of the\nreligious, moral, aesthetic and logical notions pertain simply to the\nsuperficialities of things, although man flatters himself with the\nthought that here at least he is getting to the heart of the cosmos. He\ndeceives himself because these things have power to make him so happy\nand so wretched, and so he evinces, in this respect, the same conceit\nthat characterises astrology. Astrology presupposes that the heavenly\nbodies are regulated in their movements in harmony with the destiny of\nmortals: the moral man presupposes that that which concerns himself most\nnearly must also be the heart and soul of things.\n"}
{"body": "=Misconception of Dreams.=--In the dream, mankind, in epochs of crude\nprimitive civilization, thought they were introduced to a second,\nsubstantial world: here we have the source of all metaphysic. Without\nthe dream, men would never have been incited to an analysis of the\nworld. Even the distinction between soul and body is wholly due to the\nprimitive conception of the dream, as also the hypothesis of the\nembodied soul, whence the development of all superstition, and also,\nprobably, the belief in god. \"The dead still live: for they appear to\nthe living in dreams.\" So reasoned mankind at one time, and through many\nthousands of years.\n"}
{"body": "=The Scientific Spirit Prevails only Partially, not Wholly.=--The\nspecialized, minutest departments of science are dealt with purely\nobjectively. But the general universal sciences, considered as a great,\nbasic unity, posit the question--truly a very living question--: to what\npurpose? what is the use? Because of this reference to utility they are,\nas a whole, less impersonal than when looked at in their specialized\naspects. Now in the case of philosophy, as forming the apex of the\nscientific pyramid, this question of the utility of knowledge is\nnecessarily brought very conspicuously forward, so that every philosophy\nhas, unconsciously, the air of ascribing the highest utility to itself.\nIt is for this reason that all philosophies contain such a great amount\nof high flying metaphysic, and such a shrinking from the seeming\ninsignificance of the deliverances of physical science: for the\nsignificance of knowledge in relation to life must be made to appear as\ngreat as possible. This constitutes the antagonism between the\nspecialties of science and philosophy. The latter aims, as art aims, at\nimparting to life and conduct the utmost depth and significance: in the\nformer mere knowledge is sought and nothing else--whatever else be\nincidentally obtained. Heretofore there has never been a philosophical\nsystem in which philosophy itself was not made the apologist of\nknowledge [in the abstract]. On this point, at least, each is optimistic\nand insists that to knowledge the highest utility must be ascribed. They\nare all under the tyranny of logic, which is, from its very nature,\noptimism.\n"}
{"body": "=The Discordant Element in Science.=--Philosophy severed itself from\nscience when it put the question: what is that knowledge of the world\nand of life through which mankind may be made happiest? This happened\nwhen the Socratic school arose: with the standpoint of _happiness_ the\narteries of investigating science were compressed too tightly to permit\nof any circulation of the blood--and are so compressed to-day.\n"}
{"body": "=Pneumatic Explanation of Nature.=[5]--Metaphysic reads the message of\nnature as if it were written purely pneumatically, as the church and its\nlearned ones formerly did where the bible was concerned. It requires a\ngreat deal of expertness to apply to nature the same strict science of\ninterpretation that the philologists have devised for all literature,\nand to apply it for the purpose of a simple, direct interpretation of\nthe message, and at the same time, not bring out a double meaning. But,\nas in the case of books and literature, errors of exposition are far\nfrom being completely eliminated, and vestiges of allegorical and\nmystical interpretations are still to be met with in the most cultivated\ncircles, so where nature is concerned the case is--actually much worse.\n"}

{"body": "=Metaphysical World.=--It is true, there may be a metaphysical world;\nthe absolute possibility of it can scarcely be disputed. We see all\nthings through the medium of the human head and we cannot well cut off\nthis head: although there remains the question what part of the world\nwould be left after it had been cut off. But that is a purely abstract\nscientific problem and one not much calculated to give men uneasiness:\nyet everything that has heretofore made metaphysical assumptions\nvaluable, fearful or delightful to men, all that gave rise to them is\npassion, error and self deception: the worst systems of knowledge, not\nthe best, pin their tenets of belief thereto. When such methods are once\nbrought to view as the basis of all existing religions and metaphysics,\nthey are already discredited. There always remains, however, the\npossibility already conceded: but nothing at all can be made out of\nthat, to say not a word about letting happiness, salvation and life hang\nupon the threads spun from such a possibility. Accordingly, nothing\ncould be predicated of the metaphysical world beyond the fact that it is\nan elsewhere,[6] another sphere, inaccessible and incomprehensible to\nus: it would become a thing of negative properties. Even were the\nexistence of such a world absolutely established, it would nevertheless\nremain incontrovertible that of all kinds of knowledge, knowledge of\nsuch a world would be of least consequence--of even less consequence\nthan knowledge of the chemical analysis of water would be to a storm\ntossed mariner.\n"}

No presentiment [or\nintuition] can carry us any further. With perfect tranquility the\nquestion of how our conception of the world could differ so sharply from\nthe actual world as it is manifest to us, will be relegated to the\nphysiological sciences and to the history of the evolution of ideas and\norganisms.\n"}

{"body": "=Language as a Presumptive Science.=--The importance of language in the\ndevelopment of civilization consists in the fact that by means of it\nman placed one world, his own, alongside another, a place of leverage\nthat he thought so firm as to admit of his turning the rest of the\ncosmos on a pivot that he might master it. In so far as man for ages\nlooked upon mere ideas and names of things as upon aeternae veritates,\nhe evinced the very pride with which he raised himself above the brute.\nHe really supposed that in language he possessed a knowledge of the\ncosmos. The language builder was not so modest as to believe that he was\nonly giving names to things. On the contrary he thought he embodied the\nhighest wisdom concerning things in [mere] words; and, in truth,\nlanguage is the first movement in all strivings for wisdom. Here, too,\nit is _faith in ascertained truth_[8] from which the mightiest fountains\nof strength have flowed. Very tardily--only now--it dawns upon men that\nthey have propagated a monstrous error in their belief in language.\nFortunately, it is too late now to arrest and turn back the evolutionary\nprocess of the reason, which had its inception in this belief. Logic\nitself rests upon assumptions to which nothing in the world of reality\ncorresponds. For example, the correspondence of certain things to one\nanother and the identity of those things at different periods of time\nare assumptions pure and simple, but the science of logic originated in\nthe positive belief that they were not assumptions at all but\nestablished facts. It is the same with the science of mathematics which\ncertainly would never have come into existence if mankind had known from\nthe beginning that in all nature there is no perfectly straight line, no\ntrue circle, no standard of measurement.\n"}

{"body": "=Dream and Civilization.=--The function of the brain which is most\nencroached upon in slumber is the memory; not that it is wholly\nsuspended, but it is reduced to a state of imperfection as, in primitive\nages of mankind, was probably the case with everyone, whether waking or\nsleeping. Uncontrolled and entangled as it is, it perpetually confuses\nthings as a result of the most trifling similarities, yet in the same\nmental confusion and lack of control the nations invented their\nmythologies, while nowadays travelers habitually observe how prone the\nsavage is to forgetfulness, how his mind, after the least exertion of\nmemory, begins to wander and lose itself until finally he utters\nfalsehood and nonsense from sheer exhaustion. Yet, in dreams, we all\nresemble this savage. Inadequacy of distinction and error of comparison\nare the basis of the preposterous things we do and say in dreams, so\nthat when we clearly recall a dream we are startled that so much idiocy\nlurks within us. The absolute distinctness of all dream-images, due to\nimplicit faith in their substantial reality, recalls the conditions in\nwhich earlier mankind were placed, for whom hallucinations had\nextraordinary vividness, entire communities and even entire nations\nlaboring simultaneously under them. Therefore: in sleep and in dream we\nmake the pilgrimage of early mankind over again.\n"}
{"body": "=Logic of the Dream.=--During sleep the nervous system, through various\ninner provocatives, is in constant agitation. Almost all the organs act\nindependently and vigorously. The blood circulates rapidly. The posture\nof the sleeper compresses some portions of the body. The coverlets\ninfluence the sensations in different ways. The stomach carries on the\ndigestive process and acts upon other organs thereby. The intestines are\nin motion. The position of the head induces unaccustomed action. The\nfeet, shoeless, no longer pressing the ground, are the occasion of other\nsensations of novelty, as is, indeed, the changed garb of the entire\nbody. All these things, following the bustle and change of the day,\nresult, through their novelty, in a movement throughout the entire\nsystem that extends even to the brain functions. Thus there are a\nhundred circumstances to induce perplexity in the mind, a questioning as\nto the cause of this excitation. Now, the dream is a _seeking and\npresenting of reasons_ for these excitations of feeling, of the supposed\nreasons, that is to say. Thus, for example, whoever has his feet bound\nwith two threads will probably dream that a pair of serpents are coiled\nabout his feet. This is at first a hypothesis, then a belief with an\naccompanying imaginative picture and the argument: \"these snakes must be\nthe _causa_ of those sensations which I, the sleeper, now have.\" So\nreasons the mind of the sleeper. The conditions precedent, as thus\nconjectured, become, owing to the excitation of the fancy, present\nrealities. Everyone knows from experience how a dreamer will transform\none piercing sound, for example, that of a bell, into another of quite a\ndifferent nature, say, the report of cannon. In his dream he becomes\naware first of the effects, which he explains by a subsequent hypothesis\nand becomes persuaded of the purely conjectural nature of the sound. But\nhow comes it that the mind of the dreamer goes so far astray when the\nsame mind, awake, is habitually cautious, careful, and so conservative\nin its dealings with hypotheses? why does the first plausible\nhypothesis of the cause of a sensation gain credit in the dreaming\nstate? (For in a dream we look upon that dream as reality, that is, we\naccept our hypotheses as fully established). I have no doubt that as men\nargue in their dreams to-day, mankind argued, even in their waking\nmoments, for thousands of years: the first _causa_, that occurred to the\nmind with reference to anything that stood in need of explanation, was\naccepted as the true explanation and served as such. (Savages show the\nsame tendency in operation, as the reports of travelers agree). In the\ndream this atavistic relic of humanity manifests its existence within\nus, for it is the foundation upon which the higher rational faculty\ndeveloped itself and still develops itself in every individual. Dreams\ncarry us back to the earlier stages of human culture and afford us a\nmeans of understanding it more clearly. Dream thought comes so easily to\nus now because we are so thoroughly trained to it through the\ninterminable stages of evolution during which this fanciful and facile\nform of theorising has prevailed. To a certain extent the dream is a\nrestorative for the brain, which, during the day, is called upon to meet\nthe many demands for trained thought made upon it by the conditions of a\nhigher civilization.--We may, if we please, become sensible, even in our\nwaking moments, of a condition that is as a door and vestibule to\ndreaming. If we close our eyes the brain immediately conjures up a\nmedley of impressions of light and color, apparently a sort of imitation\nand echo of the impressions forced in upon the brain during its waking\nmoments. And now the mind, in co-operation with the imagination,\ntransforms this formless play of light and color into definite figures,\nmoving groups, landscapes. What really takes place is a sort of\nreasoning from effect back to cause. As the brain inquires: whence these\nimpressions of light and color? it posits as the inducing causes of such\nlights and colors, those shapes and figures. They serve the brain as the\noccasions of those lights and colors because the brain, when the eyes\nare open and the senses awake, is accustomed to perceiving the cause of\nevery impression of light and color made upon it. Here again the\nimagination is continually interposing its images inasmuch as it\nparticipates in the production of the impressions made through the\nsenses day by day: and the dream-fancy does exactly the same thing--that\nis, the presumed cause is determined from the effect and _after_ the\neffect: all this, too, with extraordinary rapidity, so that in this\nmatter, as in a matter of jugglery or sleight-of-hand, a confusion of\nthe mind is produced and an after effect is made to appear a\nsimultaneous action, an inverted succession of events, even.--From\nthese considerations we can see how _late_ strict, logical thought, the\ntrue notion of cause and effect must have been in developing, since our\nintellectual and rational faculties to this very day revert to these\nprimitive processes of deduction, while practically half our lifetime is\nspent in the super-inducing conditions.--Even the poet, the artist,\nascribes to his sentimental and emotional states causes which are not\nthe true ones. To that extent he is a reminder of early mankind and can\naid us in its comprehension.\n"}
{"body": "=Association.=[9]--All strong feelings are associated with a variety of\nallied sentiments and emotions. They stir up the memory at the same\ntime. When we are under their influence we are reminded of similar\nstates and we feel a renewal of them within us. Thus are formed habitual\nsuccessions of feelings and notions, which, at last, when they follow\none another with lightning rapidity are no longer felt as complexities\nbut as unities. In this sense we hear of moral feelings, of religious\nfeelings, as if they were absolute unities. In reality they are streams\nwith a hundred sources and tributaries. Here again, the unity of the\nword speaks nothing for the unity of the thing.\n"}

What they claim is that through the medium of profound\nfeelings one can penetrate deep into the soul of things (Innre), draw\nclose to the heart of nature. But these feelings are deep only in so far\nas with them are simultaneously aroused, although almost imperceptibly,\ncertain complicated groups of thoughts (Gedankengruppen) which we call\ndeep: a feeling is deep because we deem the thoughts accompanying it\ndeep. But deep thought can nevertheless be very widely sundered from\ntruth, as for instance every metaphysical thought. Take from deep\nfeeling the element of thought blended with it and all that remains is\n_strength_ of feeling which is no voucher for the validity of\nknowledge, as intense faith is evidence only of its own intensity and\nnot of the truth of that in which the faith is felt.\n"}

{"body": "=Phenomenon and Thing-in-Itself.=--The philosophers are in the habit of\nplacing themselves in front of life and experience--that which they call\nthe world of phenomena--as if they were standing before a picture that\nis unrolled before them in its final completeness. This panorama, they\nthink, must be studied in every detail in order to reach some conclusion\nregarding the object represented by the picture. From effect,\naccordingly is deduced cause and from cause is deduced the\nunconditioned. This process is generally looked upon as affording the\nall sufficient explanation of the world of phenomena. On the other hand\none must, (while putting the conception of the metaphysical distinctly\nforward as that of the unconditioned, and consequently of the\nunconditioning) absolutely deny any connection between the unconditioned\n(of the metaphysical world) and the world known to us: so that\nthroughout phenomena there is no manifestation of the thing-in-itself,\nand getting from one to the other is out of the question. Thus is left\nquite ignored the circumstance that the picture--that which we now call\nlife and experience--is a gradual evolution, is, indeed, still in\nprocess of evolution and for that reason should not be regarded as an\nenduring whole from which any conclusion as to its author (the\nall-sufficient reason) could be arrived at, or even pronounced out of\nthe question. It is because we have for thousands of years looked into\nthe world with moral, aesthetic, religious predispositions, with blind\nprejudice, passion or fear, and surfeited ourselves with indulgence in\nthe follies of illogical thought, that the world has gradually become so\nwondrously motley, frightful, significant, soulful: it has taken on\ntints, but we have been the colorists: the human intellect, upon the\nfoundation of human needs, of human passions, has reared all these\n\"phenomena\" and injected its own erroneous fundamental conceptions into\nthings. Late, very late, the human intellect checks itself: and now the\nworld of experience and the thing-in-itself seem to it so severed and so\nantithetical that it denies the possibility of one's hinging upon the\nother--or else summons us to surrender our intellect, our personal will,\nto the secret and the awe-inspiring in order that thereby we may attain\ncertainty of certainty hereafter. Again, there are those who have\ncombined all the characteristic features of our world of\nphenomena--that is, the conception of the world which has been formed\nand inherited through a series of intellectual vagaries--and instead of\nholding the intellect responsible for it all, have pronounced the very\nnature of things accountable for the present very sinister aspect of the\nworld, and preached annihilation of existence. Through all these views\nand opinions the toilsome, steady process of science (which now for the\nfirst time begins to celebrate its greatest triumph in the genesis of\nthought) will definitely work itself out, the result, being, perhaps, to\nthe following effect: That which we now call the world is the result of\na crowd of errors and fancies which gradually developed in the general\nevolution of organic nature, have grown together and been transmitted to\nus as the accumulated treasure of all the past--as the _treasure_, for\nwhatever is worth anything in our humanity rests upon it. From this\nworld of conception it is in the power of science to release us only to\na slight extent--and this is all that could be wished--inasmuch as it\ncannot eradicate the influence of hereditary habits of feeling, but it\ncan light up by degrees the stages of the development of that world of\nconception, and lift us, at least for a time, above the whole spectacle.\nPerhaps we may then perceive that the thing-in-itself is a meet subject\nfor Homeric laughter: that it seemed so much, everything, indeed, and\nis really a void--void, that is to say, of meaning.\n"}
{"body": "=Metaphysical Explanation.=--Man, when he is young, prizes metaphysical\nexplanations, because they make him see matters of the highest import in\nthings he found disagreeable or contemptible: and if he is not satisfied\nwith himself, this feeling of dissatisfaction is soothed when he sees\nthe most hidden world-problem or world-pain in that which he finds so\ndispleasing in himself. To feel himself more unresponsible and at the\nsame time to find things (Dinge) more interesting--that is to him the\ndouble benefit he owes to metaphysics. Later, indeed, he acquires\ndistrust of the whole metaphysical method of explaining things: he then\nperceives, perhaps, that those effects could have been attained just as\nwell and more scientifically by another method: that physical and\nhistorical explanations would, at least, have given that feeling of\nfreedom from personal responsibility just as well, while interest in\nlife and its problems would be stimulated, perhaps, even more.\n"}
{"body": "=The Fundamental Problems of Metaphysics.=--If a history of the\ndevelopment of thought is ever written, the following proposition,\nadvanced by a distinguished logician, will be illuminated with a new\nlight: \"The universal, primordial law of the apprehending subject\nconsists in the inner necessity of cognizing every object by itself, as\nin its essence a thing unto itself, therefore as self-existing and\nunchanging, in short, as a substance.\" Even this law, which is here\ncalled \"primordial,\" is an evolution: it has yet to be shown how\ngradually this evolution takes place in lower organizations: how the\ndim, mole eyes of such organizations see, at first, nothing but a blank\nsameness: how later, when the various excitations of desire and aversion\nmanifest themselves, various substances are gradually distinguished, but\neach with an attribute, that is, a special relationship to such an\norganization. The first step towards the logical is judgment, the\nessence of which, according to the best logicians, is belief. At the\nfoundation of all beliefs lie sensations of pleasure or pain in relation\nto the apprehending subject. A third feeling, as the result of two\nprior, single, separate feelings, is judgment in its crudest form. We\norganic beings are primordially interested by nothing whatever in any\nthing (Ding) except its relation to ourselves with reference to pleasure\nand pain. Between the moments in which we are conscious of this\nrelation, (the states of feeling) lie the moments of rest, of\nnot-feeling: then the world and every thing (Ding) have no interest for\nus: we observe no change in them (as at present a person absorbed in\nsomething does not notice anyone passing by). To plants all things are,\nas a rule, at rest, eternal, every object like itself. From the period\nof lower organisms has been handed down to man the belief that there are\nlike things (gleiche Dinge): only the trained experience attained\nthrough the most advanced science contradicts this postulate. The\nprimordial belief of all organisms is, perhaps, that all the rest of the\nworld is one thing and motionless.--Furthest away from this first step\ntowards the logical is the notion of causation: even to-day we think\nthat all our feelings and doings are, at bottom, acts of the free will;\nwhen the sentient individual contemplates himself he deems every\nfeeling, every change, a something isolated, disconnected, that is to\nsay, unqualified by any thing; it comes suddenly to the surface,\nindependent of anything that went before or came after. We are hungry,\nbut originally we do not know that the organism must be nourished: on\nthe contrary that feeling seems to manifest itself without reason or\npurpose; it stands out by itself and seems quite independent. Therefore:\nthe belief in the freedom of the will is a primordial error of\neverything organic as old as the very earliest inward prompting of the\nlogical faculty; belief in unconditioned substances and in like things\n(gleiche Dinge) is also a primordial and equally ancient error of\neverything organic. Inasmuch as all metaphysic has concerned itself\nparticularly with substance and with freedom of the will, it should be\ndesignated as the science that deals with the fundamental errors of\nmankind as if they were fundamental truths.\n"}
{"body": "=Number.=--The invention of the laws of number has as its basis the\nprimordial and prior-prevailing delusion that many like things exist\n(although in point of fact there is no such thing is a duplicate), or\nthat, at least, there are things (but there is no \"thing\"). The\nassumption of plurality always presupposes that _something_ exists which\nmanifests itself repeatedly, but just here is where the delusion\nprevails; in this very matter we feign realities, unities, that have no\nexistence. Our feelings, notions, of space and time are false for they\nlead, when duly tested, to logical contradictions. In all scientific\ndemonstrations we always unavoidably base our calculation upon some\nfalse standards [of duration or measurement] but as these standards are\nat least _constant_, as, for example, our notions of time and space, the\nresults arrived at by science possess absolute accuracy and certainty in\ntheir relationship to one another: one can keep on building upon\nthem--until is reached that final limit at which the erroneous\nfundamental conceptions, (the invariable breakdown) come into conflict\nwith the results established--as, for example, in the case of the atomic\ntheory. Here we always find ourselves obliged to give credence to a\n\"thing\" or material \"substratum\" that is set in motion, although, at the\nsame time, the whole scientific programme has had as its aim the\nresolving of everything material into motions [themselves]: here again\nwe distinguish with our feeling [that which does the] moving and [that\nwhich is] moved,[11] and we never get out of this circle, because the\nbelief in things[12] has been from time immemorial rooted in our\nnature.--When Kant says \"the intellect does not derive its laws from\nnature, but dictates them to her\" he states the full truth as regards\nthe _idea of nature_ which we form (nature = world, as notion, that is,\nas error) but which is merely the synthesis of a host of errors of the\nintellect. To a world not [the outcome of] our conception, the laws of\nnumber are wholly inapplicable: such laws are valid only in the world of\nmankind.\n"}

Then a\nbackward movement is necessary: he must appreciate the historical\njustification, and to an equal extent the psychological considerations,\nin such a movement. He must understand that the greatest advances made\nby mankind have resulted from such a course and that without this very\nbackward movement the highest achievements of man hitherto would have\nbeen impossible.--With regard to philosophical metaphysics I see ever\nmore and more who have arrived at the negative goal (that all positive\nmetaphysic is a delusion) but as yet very few who go a few steps\nbackward: one should look out over the last rungs of the ladder, but not\ntry to stand on them, that is to say. The most advanced as yet go only\nfar enough to free themselves from metaphysic and look back at it with\nan air of superiority: whereas here, no less than in the hippodrome, it\nis necessary to turn around in order to reach the end of the course.\n"}
{"body": "=Presumable [Nature of the] Victory of Doubt.=--Let us assume for a\nmoment the validity of the skeptical standpoint: granted that there is\nno metaphysical world, and that all the metaphysical explanations of the\nonly world we know are useless to us, how would we then contemplate men\nand things? [Menschen und Dinge]. This can be thought out and it is\nworth while doing so, even if the question whether anything metaphysical\nhas ever been demonstrated by or through Kant and Schopenhauer, be put\naltogether aside. For it is, to all appearances, highly probable that\nmen, on this point, will be, in the mass, skeptical. The question thus\nbecomes: what sort of a notion will human society, under the influence\nof such a state of mind, form of itself? Perhaps the _scientific\ndemonstration_ of any metaphysical world is now so difficult that\nmankind will never be free from a distrust of it. And when there is\nformed a feeling of distrust of metaphysics, the results are, in the\nmass, the same as if metaphysics were refuted altogether and _could_ no\nlonger be believed. In both cases the historical question, with regard\nto an unmetaphysical disposition in mankind, remains the same.\n"}
{"body": "=Disbelief in the \"monumentum aere perennius\".=[13]--A decided\ndisadvantage, attending the termination of metaphysical modes of\nthought, is that the individual fixes his mind too attentively upon his\nown brief lifetime and feels no strong inducement to aid in the\nfoundation of institutions capable of enduring for centuries: he wishes\nhimself to gather the fruit from the tree that he plants and\nconsequently he no longer plants those trees which require centuries of\nconstant cultivation and are destined to afford shade to generation\nafter generation in the future. For metaphysical views inspire the\nbelief that in them is afforded the final sure foundation upon which\nhenceforth the whole future of mankind may rest and be built up: the\nindividual promotes his own salvation; when, for example, he builds a\nchurch or a monastery he is of opinion that he is doing something for\nthe salvation of his immortal soul:--Can science, as well, inspire such\nfaith in the efficacy of her results? In actual fact, science requires\ndoubt and distrust as her surest auxiliaries; nevertheless, the sum of\nthe irresistible (that is all the onslaughts of skepticism, all the\ndisintegrating effects of surviving truths) can easily become so great\n(as, for instance, in the case of hygienic science) as to inspire the\ndetermination to build \"eternal\" works upon it. At present the contrast\nbetween our excitated ephemeral existence and the tranquil repose of\nmetaphysical epochs is too great because both are as yet in too close\njuxtaposition. The individual man himself now goes through too many\nstages of inner and outer evolution for him to venture to make a plan\neven for his life time alone. A perfectly modern man, indeed, who wants\nto build himself a house feels as if he were walling himself up alive in\na mausoleum.\n"}

Who now feels any great impulse to establish himself and his\nposterity in a particular place? For whom, moreover, does there exist,\nat present, any strong tie? As all the methods of the arts were copied\nfrom one another, so were all the methods and advancements of moral\ncodes, of manners, of civilizations.--Such an age derives its\nsignificance from the fact that in it the various ideas, codes, manners\nand civilizations can be compared and experienced side by side; which\nwas impossible at an earlier period in view of the localised nature of\nthe rule of every civilization, corresponding to the limitation of all\nartistic effects by time and place. To-day the growth of the aesthetic\nfeeling is decided, owing to the great number of [artistic] forms which\noffer themselves for comparison. The majority--those that are condemned\nby the method of comparison--will be allowed to die out. In the same way\nthere is to-day taking place a selection of the forms and customs of the\nhigher morality which can result only in the extinction of the vulgar\nmoralities. This is the age of comparison! That is its glory--but also\nits pain. Let us not, however shrink from this pain.

{"body": "=Possibility of Progress.=--When a master of the old civilization (den\nalten Cultur) vows to hold no more discussion with men who believe in\nprogress, he is quite right. For the old civilization[14] has its\ngreatness and its advantages behind it, and historic training forces one\nto acknowledge that it can never again acquire vigor: only intolerable\nstupidity or equally intolerable fanaticism could fail to perceive this\nfact. But men may consciously determine to evolve to a new civilization\nwhere formerly they evolved unconsciously and accidentally. They can now\ndevise better conditions for the advancement of mankind, for their\nnourishment, training and education, they can administer the earth as an\neconomic power, and, particularly, compare the capacities of men and\nselect them accordingly. This new, conscious civilization is killing the\nother which, on the whole, has led but an unreflective animal and plant\nlife: it is also destroying the doubt of progress itself--progress is\npossible. I mean: it is hasty and almost unreflective to assume that\nprogress must _necessarily_ take place: but how can it be doubted that\nprogress is possible? On the other hand, progress in the sense and along\nthe lines of the old civilization is not even conceivable. If romantic\nfantasy employs the word progress in connection with certain aims and\nends identical with those of the circumscribed primitive national\ncivilizations, the picture presented of progress is always borrowed from\nthe past.

{"body": "=Private Ethics and World Ethics.=--Since the extinction of the belief\nthat a god guides the general destiny of the world and, notwithstanding\nall the contortions and windings of the path of mankind, leads it\ngloriously forward, men must shape oecumenical, world-embracing ends for\nthemselves. The older ethics, namely Kant's, required of the individual\nsuch a course of conduct as he wishes all men to follow. This evinces\nmuch simplicity--as if any individual could determine off hand what\ncourse of conduct would conduce to the welfare of humanity, and what\ncourse of conduct is pre\u00ebminently desirable! This is a theory like that\nof freedom of competition, which takes it for granted that the general\nharmony [of things] _must_ prevail of itself in accordance with some\ninherent law of betterment or amelioration. It may be that a later\ncontemplation of the needs of mankind will reveal that it is by no means\ndesirable that all men should regulate their conduct according to the\nsame principle; it may be best, from the standpoint of certain ends yet\nto be attained, that men, during long periods should regulate their\nconduct with reference to special, and even, in certain circumstances,\nevil, objects. At any rate, if mankind is not to be led astray by such a\nuniversal rule of conduct, it behooves it to attain a _knowledge of the\ncondition of culture_ that will serve as a scientific standard of\ncomparison in connection with cosmical ends. Herein is comprised the\ntremendous mission of the great spirits of the next century.\n"}
{"body": "=Reaction as Progress.=--Occasionally harsh, powerful, impetuous, yet\nnevertheless backward spirits, appear, who try to conjure back some past\nera in the history of mankind: they serve as evidence that the new\ntendencies which they oppose, are not yet potent enough, that there is\nsomething lacking in them: otherwise they [the tendencies] would better\nwithstand the effects of this conjuring back process. Thus Luther's\nreformation shows that in his century all the impulses to freedom of the\nspirit were still uncertain, lacking in vigor, and immature. Science\ncould not yet rear her head. Indeed the whole Renaissance appears but as\nan early spring smothered in snow. But even in the present century\nSchopenhauer's metaphysic shows that the scientific spirit is not yet\npowerful enough: for the whole mediaeval Christian world-standpoint\n(Weltbetrachtung) and conception of man (Mensch-Empfindung)[15] once\nagain, notwithstanding the slowly wrought destruction of all Christian\ndogma, celebrated a resurrection in Schopenhauer's doctrine. There is\nmuch science in his teaching although the science does not dominate,\nbut, instead of it, the old, trite \"metaphysical necessity.\" It is one\nof the greatest and most priceless advantages of Schopenhauer's teaching\nthat by it our feelings are temporarily forced back to those old human\nand cosmical standpoints to which no other path could conduct us so\neasily. The gain for history and justice is very great. I believe that\nwithout Schopenhauer's aid it would be no easy matter for anyone now to\ndo justice to Christianity and its Asiatic relatives--a thing impossible\nas regards the christianity that still survives. After according this\ngreat triumph to justice, after we have corrected in so essential a\nrespect the historical point of view which the age of learning brought\nwith it, we may begin to bear still farther onward the banner of\nenlightenment--a banner bearing the three names: Petrarch, Erasmus,\nVoltaire.

At the same\ntime, it should be further explained that the needs which religion\nsatisfies and which science must now satisfy, are not immutable. Even\nthey can be diminished and uprooted. Think, for instance, of the\nchristian soul-need, the sighs over one's inner corruption, the anxiety\nregarding salvation--all notions that arise simply out of errors of the\nreason and require no satisfaction at all, but annihilation. A\nphilosophy can either so affect these needs as to appease them or else\nput them aside altogether, for they are acquired, circumscribed needs,\nbased upon hypotheses which those of science explode. Here, for the\npurpose of affording the means of transition, for the sake of lightening\nthe spirit overburdened with feeling, art can be employed to far better\npurpose, as these hypotheses receive far less support from art than from\na metaphysical philosophy. Then from art it is easier to go over to a\nreally emancipating philosophical science.\n"}

For the occasion for using them grows daily\nless; only drivelers now find them indispensably necessary. What earthly\nreason could anyone have for being an optimist unless he had a god to\ndefend who _must_ have created the best of all possible worlds, since he\nis himself all goodness and perfection?--but what thinking man has now\nany need for the hypothesis that there is a god?--There is also no\noccasion whatever for a pessimistic confession of faith, unless one has\na personal interest in denouncing the advocate of god, the theologian or\nthe theological philosopher, and maintaining the counter proposition\nthat evil reigns, that wretchedness is more potent than joy, that the\nworld is a piece of botch work, that phenomenon (Erscheinung) is but the\nmanifestation of some evil spirit. But who bothers his head about the\ntheologians any more--except the theologians themselves? Apart from all\ntheology and its antagonism, it is manifest that the world is neither\ngood nor bad, (to say nothing about its being the best or the worst) and\nthat these ideas of \"good\" and \"bad\" have significance only in relation\nto men, indeed, are without significance at all, in view of the sense in\nwhich they are usually employed.

{"body": "=Intoxicated by the Perfume of Flowers.=--The ship of humanity, it is\nthought, acquires an ever deeper draught the more it is laden. It is\nbelieved that the more profoundly man thinks, the more exquisitely he\nfeels, the higher the standard he sets for himself, the greater his\ndistance from the other animals--the more he appears as a genius\n(Genie) among animals--the nearer he gets to the true nature of the\nworld and to comprehension thereof: this, indeed, he really does through\nscience, but he thinks he does it far more adequately through his\nreligions and arts. These are, certainly, a blossoming of the world, but\nnot, therefore, _nearer the roots of the world_ than is the stalk. One\ncannot learn best from it the nature of the world, although nearly\neveryone thinks so. _Error_ has made men so deep, sensitive and\nimaginative in order to bring forth such flowers as religions and arts.\nPure apprehension would be unable to do that.

Not\nthe world as thing-in-itself but the world as idea[16] (as error) is\nrich in portent, deep, wonderful, carrying happiness and unhappiness in\nits womb.

The free spirit, who is sensible\nof the defect in this method of reaching conclusions and has had to\nsuffer its consequences, often succumbs to the temptation to come to the\nvery opposite conclusions (which, in general, are, of course, equally\nerroneous): a thing cannot maintain itself: therefore it is good; a\nbelief is troublesome, therefore it is true.\n"}

The\nillogical is so imbedded in the passions, in language, in art, in\nreligion and, above all, in everything that imparts value to life that\nit cannot be taken away without irreparably injuring those beautiful\nthings. Only men of the utmost simplicity can believe that the nature\nman knows can be changed into a purely logical nature. Yet were there\nsteps affording approach to this goal, how utterly everything would be\nlost on the way! Even the most rational man needs nature again, from\ntime to time, that is, his illogical fundamental relation\n(Grundstellung) to all things.\n"}
{"body": "=Being Unjust is Essential.=--All judgments of the value of life are\nillogically developed and therefore unjust. The vice of the judgment\nconsists, first, in the way in which the subject matter comes under\nobservation, that is, very incompletely; secondly in the way in which\nthe total is summed up; and, thirdly, in the fact that each single item\nin the totality of the subject matter is itself the result of defective\nperception, and this from absolute necessity. No practical knowledge of\na man, for example, stood he never so near to us, can be complete--so\nthat we could have a logical right to form a total estimate of him; all\nestimates are summary and must be so. Then the standard by which we\nmeasure, (our being) is not an immutable quantity; we have moods and\nvariations, and yet we should know ourselves as an invariable standard\nbefore we undertake to establish the nature of the relation of any thing\n(Sache) to ourselves. Perhaps it will follow from all this that one\nshould form no judgments whatever; if one could but merely _live_\nwithout having to form estimates, without aversion and without\npartiality!--for everything most abhorred is closely connected with an\nestimate, as well as every strongest partiality. An inclination towards\na thing, or from a thing, without an accompanying feeling that the\nbeneficial is desired and the pernicious contemned, an inclination\nwithout a sort of experiential estimation of the desirability of an end,\ndoes not exist in man. We are primordially illogical and hence unjust\nbeings _and can recognise this fact_: this is one of the greatest and\nmost baffling discords of existence.\n"}
{"body": "=Error Respecting Living for the Sake of Living Essential.=--Every\nbelief in the value and worthiness of life rests upon defective\nthinking; it is for this reason alone possible that sympathy with the\ngeneral life and suffering of mankind is so imperfectly developed in the\nindividual. Even exceptional men, who can think beyond their own\npersonalities, do not have this general life in view, but isolated\nportions of it. If one is capable of fixing his observation upon\nexceptional cases, I mean upon highly endowed individuals and pure\nsouled beings, if their development is taken as the true end of\nworld-evolution and if joy be felt in their existence, then it is\npossible to believe in the value of life, because in that case the rest\nof humanity is overlooked: hence we have here defective thinking. So,\ntoo, it is even if all mankind be taken into consideration, and one\nspecies only of impulses (the less egoistic) brought under review and\nthose, in consideration of the other impulses, exalted: then something\ncould still be hoped of mankind in the mass and to that extent there\ncould exist belief in the value of life: here, again, as a result of\ndefective thinking. Whatever attitude, thus, one may assume, one is, as\na result of this attitude, an exception among mankind. Now, the great\nmajority of mankind endure life without any great protest, and believe,\nto this extent, in the value of existence, but that is because each\nindividual decides and determines alone, and never comes out of his own\npersonality like these exceptions: everything outside of the personal\nhas no existence for them or at the utmost is observed as but a faint\nshadow. Consequently the value of life for the generality of mankind\nconsists simply in the fact that the individual attaches more importance\nto himself than he does to the world. The great lack of imagination from\nwhich he suffers is responsible for his inability to enter into the\nfeelings of beings other than himself, and hence his sympathy with their\nfate and suffering is of the slightest possible description. On the\nother hand, whosoever really _could_ sympathise, necessarily doubts the\nvalue of life; were it possible for him to sum up and to feel in himself\nthe total consciousness of mankind, he would collapse with a malediction\nagainst existence,--for mankind is, in the mass, without a goal, and\nhence man cannot find, in the contemplation of his whole course,\nanything to serve him as a mainstay and a comfort, but rather a reason\nto despair. If he looks beyond the things that immediately engage him to\nthe final aimlessness of humanity, his own conduct assumes in his eyes\nthe character of a frittering away. To feel oneself, however, as\nhumanity (not alone as an individual) frittered away exactly as we see\nthe stray leaves frittered away by nature, is a feeling transcending all\nfeeling. But who is capable of it? Only a poet, certainly: and poets\nalways know how to console themselves.\n"}
{"body": "=For Tranquility.=--But will not our philosophy become thus a tragedy?\nWill not truth prove the enemy of life, of betterment? A question seems\nto weigh upon our tongue and yet will not put itself into words: whether\none _can_ knowingly remain in the domain of the untruthful? or, if one\n_must_, whether, then, death would not be preferable? For there is no\nlonger any ought (Sollen), morality; so far as it is involved \"ought,\"\nis, through our point of view, as utterly annihilated as religion. Our\nknowledge can permit only pleasure and pain, benefit and injury, to\nsubsist as motives. But how can these motives be distinguished from the\ndesire for truth? Even they rest upon error (in so far, as already\nstated, partiality and dislike and their very inaccurate estimates\npalpably modify our pleasure and our pain). The whole of human life is\ndeeply involved in _untruth_. The individual cannot extricate it from\nthis pit without thereby fundamentally clashing with his whole past,\nwithout finding his present motives of conduct, (as that of honor)\nillegitimate, and without opposing scorn and contempt to the ambitions\nwhich prompt one to have regard for the future and for one's happiness\nin the future. Is it true, does there, then, remain but one way of\nthinking, which, as a personal consequence brings in its train despair,\nand as a theoretical [consequence brings in its train] a philosophy of\ndecay, disintegration, self annihilation? I believe the deciding\ninfluence, as regards the after-effect of knowledge, will be the\n_temperament_ of a man; I can, in addition to this after-effect just\nmentioned, suppose another, by means of which a much simpler life, and\none freer from disturbances than the present, could be lived; so that at\nfirst the old motives of vehement passion might still have strength,\nowing to hereditary habit, but they would gradually grow weaker under\nthe influence of purifying knowledge. A man would live, at last, both\namong men and unto himself, as in the natural state, without praise,\nreproach, competition, feasting one's eyes, as if it were a play, upon\nmuch that formerly inspired dread. One would be rid of the strenuous\nelement, and would no longer feel the goad of the reflection that man is\nnot even [as much as] nature, nor more than nature. To be sure, this\nrequires, as already stated, a good temperament, a fortified, gentle and\nnaturally cheerful soul, a disposition that has no need to be on its\nguard against its own eccentricities and sudden outbreaks and that in\nits utterances manifests neither sullenness nor a snarling tone--those\nfamiliar, disagreeable characteristics of old dogs and old men that have\nbeen a long time chained up. Rather must a man, from whom the ordinary\nbondages of life have fallen away to so great an extent, so do that he\nonly lives on in order to grow continually in knowledge, and to learn to\nresign, without envy and without disappointment, much, yes nearly\neverything, that has value in the eyes of men. He must be content with\nsuch a free, fearless soaring above men, manners, laws and traditional\nestimates of things, as the most desirable of all situations. He will\nfreely share the joy of being in such a situation, and he has, perhaps,\nnothing else to share--in which renunciation and self-denial really most\nconsist. But if more is asked of him, he will, with a benevolent shake\nof the head, refer to his brother, the free man of fact, and will,\nperhaps, not dissemble a little contempt: for, as regards his \"freedom,\"\nthereby hangs a tale.[18]\n"}

{"body": "=Advantages of Psychological Observation.=--That reflection regarding\nthe human, all-too-human--or as the learned jargon is: psychological\nobservation--is among the means whereby the burden of life can be made\nlighter, that practice in this art affords presence of mind in difficult\nsituations and entertainment amid a wearisome environment, aye, that\nmaxims may be culled in the thorniest and least pleasing paths of life\nand invigoration thereby obtained: this much was believed, was known--in\nformer centuries. Why was this forgotten in our own century, during\nwhich, at least in Germany, yes in Europe, poverty as regards\npsychological observation would have been manifest in many ways had\nthere been anyone to whom this poverty could have manifested itself. Not\nonly in the novel, in the romance, in philosophical standpoints--these\nare the works of exceptional men; still more in the state of opinion\nregarding public events and personages; above all in general society,\nwhich says much about men but nothing whatever about man, there is\ntotally lacking the art of psychological analysis and synthesis. But why\nis the richest and most harmless source of entertainment thus allowed to\nrun to waste? Why is the greatest master of the psychological maxim no\nlonger read?--for, with no exaggeration whatever be it said: the\neducated person in Europe who has read La Rochefoucauld and his\nintellectual and artistic affinities is very hard to find; still harder,\nthe person who knows them and does not disparage them. Apparently, too,\nthis unusual reader takes far less pleasure in them than the form\nadopted by these artists should afford him: for the subtlest mind cannot\nadequately appreciate the art of maxim-making unless it has had training\nin it, unless it has competed in it. Without such practical\nacquaintance, one is apt to look upon this making and forming as a much\neasier thing than it really is; one is not keenly enough alive to the\nfelicity and the charm of success. Hence present day readers of maxims\nhave but a moderate, tempered pleasure in them, scarcely, indeed, a true\nperception of their merit, so that their experiences are about the same\nas those of the average beholder of cameos: people who praise because\nthey cannot appreciate, and are very ready to admire and still readier\nto turn away.\n"}
{"body": "=Objection.=--Or is there a counter-proposition to the dictum that\npsychological observation is one of the means of consoling, lightening,\ncharming existence? Have enough of the unpleasant effects of this art\nbeen experienced to justify the person striving for culture in turning\nhis regard away from it? In all truth, a certain blind faith in the\ngoodness of human nature, an implanted distaste for any disparagement of\nhuman concerns, a sort of shamefacedness at the nakedness of the soul,\nmay be far more desirable things in the general happiness of a man, than\nthis only occasionally advantageous quality of psychological\nsharpsightedness; and perhaps belief in the good, in virtuous men and\nactions, in a plenitude of disinterested benevolence has been more\nproductive of good in the world of men in so far as it has made men less\ndistrustful. If Plutarch's heroes are enthusiastically imitated and a\nreluctance is experienced to looking too critically into the motives of\ntheir actions, not the knowledge but the welfare of human society is\npromoted thereby: psychological error and above all obtuseness in regard\nto it, help human nature forward, whereas knowledge of the truth is more\npromoted by means of the stimulating strength of a hypothesis; as La\nRochefoucauld in the first edition of his \"Sentences and Moral Maxims\"\nhas expressed it: \"What the world calls virtue is ordinarily but a\nphantom created by the passions, and to which we give a good name in\norder to do whatever we please with impunity.\" La Rochefoucauld and\nthose other French masters of soul-searching (to the number of whom has\nlately been added a German, the author of \"Psychological Observations\")\nare like expert marksmen who again and again hit the black spot--but it\nis the black spot in human nature. Their art inspires amazement, but\nfinally some spectator, inspired, not by the scientific spirit but by a\nhumanitarian feeling, execrates an art that seems to implant in the soul\na taste for belittling and impeaching mankind.\n"}
{"body": "=Nevertheless.=--The matter therefore, as regards pro and con, stands\nthus: in the present state of philosophy an awakening of the moral\nobservation is essential. The repulsive aspect of psychological\ndissection, with the knife and tweezers entailed by the process, can no\nlonger be spared humanity. Such is the imperative duty of any science\nthat investigates the origin and history of the so-called moral feelings\nand which, in its progress, is called upon to posit and to solve\nadvanced social problems:--The older philosophy does not recognize the\nnewer at all and, through paltry evasions, has always gone astray in the\ninvestigation of the origin and history of human estimates\n(Werthsch\u00e4tzungen). With what results may now be very clearly perceived,\nsince it has been shown by many examples, how the errors of the greatest\nphilosophers have their origin in a false explanation of certain human\nactions and feelings; how upon the foundation of an erroneous analysis\n(for example, of the so called disinterested actions), a false ethic is\nreared, to support which religion and like mythological monstrosities\nare called in, until finally the shades of these troubled spirits\ncollapse in physics and in the comprehensive world point of view. But if\nit be established that superficiality of psychological observation has\nheretofore set the most dangerous snares for human judgment and\ndeduction, and will continue to do so, all the greater need is there of\nthat steady continuance of labor that never wearies putting stone upon\nstone, little stone upon little stone; all the greater need is there of\na courage that is not ashamed of such humble labor and that will oppose\npersistence, to all contempt. It is, finally, also true that countless\nsingle observations concerning the human, all-too-human, have been\nfirst made and uttered in circles accustomed, not to furnish matter for\nscientific knowledge, but for intellectual pleasure-seeking; and the\noriginal home atmosphere--a very seductive atmosphere--of the moral\nmaxim has almost inextricably interpenetrated the entire species, so\nthat the scientific man involuntarily manifests a sort of mistrust of\nthis species and of its seriousness. But it is sufficient to point to\nthe consequences: for already it is becoming evident that events of the\nmost portentous nature are developing in the domain of psychological\nobservation. What is the leading conclusion arrived at by one of the\nsubtlest and calmest of thinkers, the author of the work \"Concerning the\nOrigin of the Moral Feelings\", as a result of his thorough and incisive\nanalysis of human conduct? \"The moral man,\" he says, \"stands no nearer\nthe knowable (metaphysical) world than the physical man.\"[19] This\ndictum, grown hard and cutting beneath the hammer-blow of historical\nknowledge, can some day, perhaps, in some future or other, serve as the\naxe that will be laid to the root of the \"metaphysical necessities\" of\nmen--whether more to the blessing than to the banning of universal well\nbeing who can say?--but in any event a dictum fraught with the most\nmomentous consequences, fruitful and fearful at once, and confronting\nthe world in the two faced way characteristic of all great facts.\n"}

{"body": "=The Fable of Discretionary Freedom.=--The history of the feelings, on\nthe basis of which we make everyone responsible, hence, the so-called\nmoral feelings, is traceable in the following leading phases. At first\nsingle actions are termed good or bad without any reference to their\nmotive, but solely because of the utilitarian or prejudicial\nconsequences they have for the community. In time, however, the origin\nof these designations is forgotten [but] it is imagined that action in\nitself, without reference to its consequences, contains the property\n\"good\" or \"bad\": with the same error according to which language\ndesignates the stone itself as hard[ness] the tree itself as\ngreen[ness]--for the reason, therefore, that what is a consequence is\ncomprehended as a cause. Accordingly, the good[ness] or bad[ness] is\nincorporated into the motive and [any] deed by itself is regarded as\nmorally ambiguous. A step further is taken, and the predication good or\nbad is no longer made of the particular motives but of the entire nature\nof a man, out of which motive grows as grow the plants out of the soil.\nThus man is successively made responsible for his [particular] acts,\nthen for his [course of] conduct, then for his motives and finally for\nhis nature. Now, at last, is it discovered that this nature, even,\ncannot be responsible, inasmuch as it is only and wholly a necessary\nconsequence and is synthesised out of the elements and influence of past\nand present things: therefore, that man is to be made responsible for\nnothing, neither for his nature, nor his motives, nor his [course of]\nconduct nor his [particular] acts. By this [process] is gained the\nknowledge that the history of moral estimates is the history of error,\nof the error of responsibility: as is whatever rests upon the error of\nthe freedom of the will. Schopenhauer concluded just the other way,\nthus: since certain actions bring depression (\"consciousness of guilt\")\nin their train, there must, then, exist responsibility, for there would\nbe no basis for this depression at hand if all man's affairs did not\nfollow their course of necessity--as they do, indeed, according to the\nopinion of this philosopher, follow their course--but man himself,\nsubject to the same necessity, would be just the man that he is--which\nSchopenhauer denies. From the fact of such depression Schopenhauer\nbelieves himself able to prove a freedom which man in some way must have\nhad, not indeed in regard to his actions but in regard to his nature:\nfreedom, therefore, to be thus and so, not to act thus and so. Out of\nthe _esse_, the sphere of freedom and responsibility, follows, according\nto his opinion, the _operari_, the spheres of invariable causation,\nnecessity and irresponsibility. This depression, indeed, is due\napparently to the _operari_--in so far as it be delusive--but in truth\nto whatever _esse_ be the deed of a free will, the basic cause of the\nexistence of an individual: [in order to] let man become whatever he\nwills to become, his [to] will (Wollen) must precede his\nexistence.--Here, apart from the absurdity of the statement just made,\nthere is drawn the wrong inference that the fact of the depression\nexplains its character, the rational admissibility of it: from such a\nwrong inference does Schopenhauer first come to his fantastic consequent\nof the so called discretionary freedom (intelligibeln Freiheit). (For\nthe origin of this fabulous entity Plato and Kant are equally\nresponsible). But depression after the act does not need to be rational:\nindeed, it is certainly not so at all, for it rests upon the erroneous\nassumption that the act need not necessarily have come to pass.\nTherefore: only because man deems himself free, but not because\nhe is free, does he experience remorse and the stings of\nconscience.--Moreover, this depression is something that can be grown\nout of; in many men it is not present at all as a consequence of acts\nwhich inspire it in many other men. It is a very varying thing and one\nclosely connected with the development of custom and civilization, and\nperhaps manifest only during a relatively brief period of the world's\nhistory.--No one is responsible for his acts, no one for his nature; to\njudge is tantamount to being unjust. This applies as well when the\nindividual judges himself. The proposition is as clear as sunlight, and\nyet here everyone prefers to go back to darkness and untruth: for fear\nof the consequences.\n"}

Without the errors involved in the\nassumptions of ethics, man would have remained an animal.

Could we conceive of a man eighty thousand years old,\nwe should have in him an absolutely alterable character; so that the\nmaturities of successive, varying individuals would develop in him.

{"body": "=Classification of Enjoyments and Ethic.=--The once accepted comparative\nclassification of enjoyments, according to which an inferior, higher,\nhighest egoism may crave one or another enjoyment, now decides as to\nethical status or unethical status. A lower enjoyment (for example,\nsensual pleasure) preferred to a more highly esteemed one (for example,\nhealth) rates as unethical, as does welfare preferred to freedom. The\ncomparative classification of enjoyments is not, however, alike or the\nsame at all periods; when anyone demands satisfaction of the law, he is,\nfrom the point of view of an earlier civilization, moral, from that of\nthe present, non-moral. \"Unethical\" indicates, therefore, that a man is\nnot sufficiently sensible to the higher, finer impulses which the\npresent civilization has brought with it, or is not sensible to them at\nall; it indicates backwardness, but only from the point of view of the\ncontemporary degree of distinction.--The comparative classification of\nenjoyments itself is not determined according to absolute ethics; but\nafter each new ethical adjustment, it is then decided whether conduct be\nethical or the reverse.\n"}

His benefactor has, through his benefaction, invaded the domain of\nthe powerful man and established himself on an equal footing: the\npowerful man in turn invades the domain of the benefactor and gets\nsatisfaction through the act of gratitude. It is a mild form of revenge.\nBy not obtaining the satisfaction of gratitude the powerful would have\nshown himself powerless and have ranked as such thenceforward. Hence\nevery society of the good, that is to say, of the powerful originally,\nplaces gratitude among the first of duties.--Swift has added the dictum\nthat man is grateful in the same degree that he is revengeful.\n"}
{"body": "=Two-fold Historical Origin of Good and Evil.=--The notion of good and\nbad has a two-fold historical origin: namely, first, in the spirit of\nruling races and castes. Whoever has power to requite good with good and\nevil with evil and actually brings requital, (that is, is grateful and\nrevengeful) acquires the name of being good; whoever is powerless and\ncannot requite is called bad. A man belongs, as a good individual, to\nthe \"good\" of a community, who have a feeling in common, because all the\nindividuals are allied with one another through the requiting sentiment.\nA man belongs, as a bad individual, to the \"bad,\" to a mass of\nsubjugated, powerless men who have no feeling in common. The good are a\ncaste, the bad are a quantity, like dust. Good and bad is, for a\nconsiderable period, tantamount to noble and servile, master and slave.\nOn the other hand an enemy is not looked upon as bad: he can requite.\nThe Trojan and the Greek are in Homer both good. Not he, who does no\nharm, but he who is despised, is deemed bad. In the community of the\ngood individuals [the quality of] good[ness] is inherited; it is\nimpossible for a bad individual to grow from such a rich soil. If,\nnotwithstanding, one of the good individuals does something unworthy of\nhis goodness, recourse is had to exorcism; thus the guilt is ascribed to\na deity, the while it is declared that this deity bewitched the good man\ninto madness and blindness.--Second, in the spirit of the subjugated,\nthe powerless. Here every other man is, to the individual, hostile,\ninconsiderate, greedy, inhuman, avaricious, be he noble or servile; bad\nis the characteristic term for man, for every living being, indeed, that\nis recognized at all, even for a god: human, divine, these notions are\ntantamount to devilish, bad. Manifestations of goodness, sympathy,\nhelpfulness, are regarded with anxiety as trickiness, preludes to an\nevil end, deception, subtlety, in short, as refined badness. With such a\npredisposition in individuals, a feeling in common can scarcely arise at\nall, at most only the rudest form of it: so that everywhere that this\nconception of good and evil prevails, the destruction of the\nindividuals, their race and nation, is imminent.--Our existing morality\nhas developed upon the foundation laid by ruling races and castes.\n"}
{"body": "=Sympathy Greater than Suffering.=--There are circumstances in which\nsympathy is stronger than the suffering itself. We feel more pain, for\ninstance, when one of our friends becomes guilty of a reprehensible\naction than if we had done the deed ourselves. We once, that is, had\nmore faith in the purity of his character than he had himself. Hence our\nlove for him, (apparently because of this very faith) is stronger than\nis his own love for himself. If, indeed, his egoism really suffers more,\nas a result, than our egoism, inasmuch as he must take the consequences\nof his fault to a greater extent than ourselves, nevertheless, the\nunegoistic--this word is not to be taken too strictly, but simply as a\nmodified form of expression--in us is more affected by his guilt than\nthe unegoistic in him.\n"}
{"body": "=Hypochondria.=--There are people who, from sympathy and anxiety for\nothers become hypochondriacal. The resulting form of compassion is\nnothing else than sickness. So, also, is there a Christian hypochondria,\nfrom which those singular, religiously agitated people suffer who place\nalways before their eyes the suffering and death of Christ.\n"}
{"body": "=Economy of Blessings.=--The advantageous and the pleasing, as the\nhealthiest growths and powers in the intercourse of men, are such\nprecious treasures that it is much to be wished the use made of these\nbalsamic means were as economical as possible: but this is impossible.\nEconomy in the use of blessings is the dream of the craziest of\nUtopians.\n"}
{"body": "=Well-Wishing.=--Among the small, but infinitely plentiful and therefore\nvery potent things to which science must pay more attention than to the\ngreat, uncommon things, well-wishing[21] must be reckoned; I mean those\nmanifestations of friendly disposition in intercourse, that laughter of\nthe eye, every hand pressure, every courtesy from which, in general,\nevery human act gets its quality. Every teacher, every functionary adds\nthis element as a gratuity to whatever he does as a duty; it is the\nperpetual well spring of humanity, like the waves of light in which\neverything grows; thus, in the narrowest circles, within the family,\nlife blooms and flowers only through this kind feeling. The\ncheerfulness, friendliness and kindness of a heart are unfailing\nsources of unegoistic impulse and have made far more for civilization\nthan those other more noised manifestations of it that are styled\nsympathy, benevolence and sacrifice. But it is customary to depreciate\nthese little tokens of kindly feeling, and, indeed, there is not much of\nthe unegoistic in them. The sum of these little doses is very great,\nnevertheless; their combined strength is of the greatest of\nstrengths.--Thus, too, much more happiness is to be found in the world\nthan gloomy eyes discover: that is, if the calculation be just, and all\nthese pleasing moments in which every day, even the meanest human life,\nis rich, be not forgotten.\n"}
{"body": "[21] Wohl-wollen, kind feeling. It stands here for benevolence but not\nbenevolence in the restricted sense of the word now prevailing.\n"}
{"body": "=The Desire to Inspire Compassion.=--La Rochefoucauld, in the most\nnotable part of his self portraiture (first printed 1658) reaches the\nvital spot of truth when he warns all those endowed with reason to be on\ntheir guard against compassion, when he advises that this sentiment be\nleft to men of the masses who stand in need of the promptings of the\nemotions (since they are not guided by reason) to induce them to give\naid to the suffering and to be of service in misfortune: whereas\ncompassion, in his (and Plato's) view, deprives the heart of strength.\nTo be sure, sympathy should be manifested but men should take care not\nto feel it; for the unfortunate are rendered so dull that the\nmanifestation of sympathy affords them the greatest happiness in the\nworld.--Perhaps a more effectual warning against this compassion can be\ngiven if this need of the unfortunate be considered not simply as\nstupidity and intellectual weakness, not as a sort of distraction of the\nspirit entailed by misfortune itself (and thus, indeed, does La\nRochefoucauld seem to view it) but as something quite different and more\nmomentous. Let note be taken of children who cry and scream in order to\nbe compassionated and who, therefore, await the moment when their\ncondition will be observed; come into contact with the sick and the\noppressed in spirit and try to ascertain if the wailing and sighing, the\nposturing and posing of misfortune do not have as end and aim the\ncausing of pain to the beholder: the sympathy which each beholder\nmanifests is a consolation to the weak and suffering only in as much as\nthey are made to perceive that at least they have the power,\nnotwithstanding all their weakness, to inflict pain. The unfortunate\nexperiences a species of joy in the sense of superiority which the\nmanifestation of sympathy entails; his imagination is exalted; he is\nalways strong enough, then, to cause the world pain. Thus is the thirst\nfor sympathy a thirst for self enjoyment and at the expense of one's\nfellow creatures: it shows man in the whole ruthlessness of his own dear\nself: not in his mere \"dullness\" as La Rochefoucauld thinks.--In social\nconversation three fourths of all the questions are asked, and three\nfourths of all the replies are made in order to inflict some little\npain; that is why so many people crave social intercourse: it gives them\na sense of their power. In these countless but very small doses in which\nthe quality of badness is administered it proves a potent stimulant of\nlife: to the same extent that well wishing--(Wohl-wollen) distributed\nthrough the world in like manner, is one of the ever ready\nrestoratives.--But will many honorable people be found to admit that\nthere is any pleasure in administering pain? that entertainment--and\nrare entertainment--is not seldom found in causing others, at least in\nthought, some pain, and in raking them with the small shot of\nwickedness? The majority are too ignoble and a few are too good to know\nanything of this pudendum: the latter may, consequently, be prompt to\ndeny that Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e is right when he says: \"Know, also, that\nnothing is more common than to do wrong for the pleasure of doing it.\"\n"}
{"body": "=How Appearance Becomes Reality.=--The actor cannot, at last, refrain,\neven in moments of the deepest pain, from thinking of the effect\nproduced by his deportment and by his surroundings--for example, even at\nthe funeral of his own child: he will weep at his own sorrow and its\nmanifestations as though he were his own audience. The hypocrite who\nalways plays one and the same part, finally ceases to be a hypocrite; as\nin the case of priests who, when young men, are always, either\nconsciously or unconsciously, hypocrites, and finally become naturally\nand then really, without affectation, mere priests: or if the father\ndoes not carry it to this extent, the son, who inherits his father's\ncalling and gets the advantage of the paternal progress, does. When\nanyone, during a long period, and persistently, wishes to appear\nsomething, it will at last prove difficult for him to be anything else.\nThe calling of almost every man, even of the artist, begins with\nhypocrisy, with an imitation of deportment, with a copying of the\neffective in manner. He who always wears the mask of a friendly man must\nat last gain a power over friendliness of disposition, without which the\nexpression itself of friendliness is not to be gained--and finally\nfriendliness of disposition gains the ascendancy over him--he _is_\nbenevolent.\n"}
{"body": "=The Point of Honor in Deception.=--In all great deceivers one\ncharacteristic is prominent, to which they owe their power. In the very\nact of deception, amid all the accompaniments, the agitation in the\nvoice, the expression, the bearing, in the crisis of the scene, there\ncomes over them a belief in themselves; this it is that acts so\neffectively and irresistibly upon the beholders. Founders of religions\ndiffer from such great deceivers in that they never come out of this\nstate of self deception, or else they have, very rarely, a few moments\nof enlightenment in which they are overcome by doubt; generally,\nhowever, they soothe themselves by ascribing such moments of\nenlightenment to the evil adversary. Self deception must exist that both\nclasses of deceivers may attain far reaching results. For men believe in\nthe truth of all that is manifestly believed with due implicitness by\nothers.\n"}
{"body": "=Presumed Degrees of Truth.=--One of the most usual errors of deduction\nis: because someone truly and openly is against us, therefore he speaks\nthe truth. Hence the child has faith in the judgments of its elders, the\nChristian in the assertions of the founder of the church. So, too, it\nwill not be admitted that all for which men sacrificed life and\nhappiness in former centuries was nothing but delusion: perhaps it is\nalleged these things were degrees of truth. But what is really meant is\nthat, if a person sincerely believes a thing and has fought and died for\nhis faith, it would be too _unjust_ if only delusion had inspired him.\nSuch a state of affairs seems to contradict eternal justice. For that\nreason the heart of a sensitive man pronounces against his head the\njudgment: between moral conduct and intellectual insight there must\nalways exist an inherent connection. It is, unfortunately, otherwise:\nfor there is no eternal justice.\n"}
{"body": "=Falsehood.=--Why do men, as a rule, speak the truth in the ordinary\naffairs of life? Certainly not for the reason that a god has forbidden\nlying. But because first: it is more convenient, as falsehood entails\ninvention, make-believe and recollection (wherefore Swift says that\nwhoever invents a lie seldom realises the heavy burden he takes up: he\nmust, namely, for every lie that he tells, insert twenty more).\nTherefore, because in plain ordinary relations of life it is expedient\nto say without circumlocution: I want this, I have done this, and the\nlike; therefore, because the way of freedom and certainty is surer than\nthat of ruse.--But if it happens that a child is brought up in sinister\ndomestic circumstances, it will then indulge in falsehood as matter of\ncourse, and involuntarily say anything its own interests may prompt: an\ninclination for truth, an aversion to falsehood, is quite foreign and\nuncongenial to it, and hence it lies in all innocence.\n"}
{"body": "=Ethic Discredited for Faith's Sake.=--No power can sustain itself when\nit is represented by mere humbugs: the Catholic Church may possess ever\nso many \"worldly\" sources of strength, but its true might is comprised\nin those still numberless priestly natures who make their lives stern\nand strenuous and whose looks and emaciated bodies are eloquent of night\nvigils, fasts, ardent prayer, perhaps even of whip lashes: these things\nmake men tremble and cause them anxiety: what, if it be really\nimperative to live thus? This is the dreadful question which their\naspect occasions. As they spread this doubt, they lay anew the prop of\ntheir power: even the free thinkers dare not oppose such\ndisinterestedness with severe truth and cry: \"Thou deceived one,\ndeceive not!\"--Only the difference of standpoint separates them from\nhim: no difference in goodness or badness. But things we cannot\naccomplish ourselves, we are apt to criticise unfairly. Thus we are told\nof the cunning and perverted acts of the Jesuits, but we overlook the\nself mastery that each Jesuit imposes upon himself and also the fact\nthat the easy life which the Jesuit manuals advocate is for the benefit,\nnot of the Jesuits but the laity. Indeed, it may be questioned whether\nwe enlightened ones would become equally competent workers as the result\nof similar tactics and organization, and equally worthy of admiration as\nthe result of self mastery, indefatigable industry and devotion.\n"}
{"body": "=Victory of Knowledge over Radical Evil.=--It proves a material gain to\nhim who would attain knowledge to have had during a considerable period\nthe idea that mankind is a radically bad and perverted thing: it is a\nfalse idea, as is its opposite, but it long held sway and its roots have\nreached down even to ourselves and our present world. In order to\nunderstand _ourselves_ we must understand _it_; but in order to attain a\nloftier height we must step above it. We then perceive that there is no\nsuch thing as sin in the metaphysical sense: but also, in the same\nsense, no such thing as virtue; that this whole domain of ethical\nnotions is one of constant variation; that there are higher and deeper\nconceptions of good and evil, moral and immoral. Whoever desires no more\nof things than knowledge of them attains speedily to peace of mind and\nwill at most err through lack of knowledge, but scarcely through\neagerness for knowledge (or through sin, as the world calls it). He will\nnot ask that eagerness for knowledge be interdicted and rooted out; but\nhis single, all powerful ambition to _know_ as thoroughly and as fully\nas possible, will soothe him and moderate all that is strenuous in his\ncircumstances. Moreover, he is now rid of a number of disturbing\nnotions; he is no longer beguiled by such words as hell-pain,\nsinfulness, unworthiness: he sees in them merely the flitting shadow\npictures of false views of life and of the world.\n"}
{"body": "=Ethic as Man's Self-Analysis.=--A good author, whose heart is really in\nhis work, wishes that someone would arise and wholly refute him if only\nthereby his subject be wholly clarified and made plain. The maid in love\nwishes that she could attest the fidelity of her own passion through\nthe faithlessness of her beloved. The soldier wishes to sacrifice his\nlife on the field of his fatherland's victory: for in the victory of his\nfatherland his highest end is attained. The mother gives her child what\nshe deprives herself of--sleep, the best nourishment and, in certain\ncircumstances, her health, her self.--But are all these acts unegoistic?\nAre these moral deeds miracles because they are, in Schopenhauer's\nphrase \"impossible and yet accomplished\"? Is it not evident that in all\nfour cases man loves one part of himself, (a thought, a longing, an\nexperience) more than he loves another part of himself? that he thus\nanalyses his being and sacrifices one part of it to another part? Is\nthis essentially different from the behavior of the obstinate man who\nsays \"I would rather be shot than go a step out of my way for this\nfellow\"?--Preference for something (wish, impulse, longing) is present\nin all four instances: to yield to it, with all its consequences, is not\n\"unegoistic.\"--In the domain of the ethical man conducts himself not as\nindividuum but as dividuum.\n"}
{"body": "=What Can be Promised.=--Actions can be promised, but not feelings, for\nthese are involuntary. Whoever promises somebody to love him always, or\nto hate him always, or to be ever true to him, promises something that\nit is out of his power to bestow. But he really can promise such courses\nof conduct as are the ordinary accompaniments of love, of hate, of\nfidelity, but which may also have their source in motives quite\ndifferent: for various ways and motives lead to the same conduct. The\npromise to love someone always, means, consequently: as long as I love\nyou, I will manifest the deportment of love; but if I cease to love you\nmy deportment, although from some other motive, will be just the same,\nso that to the people about us it will seem as if my love remained\nunchanged.--Hence it is the continuance of the deportment of love that\nis promised in every instance in which eternal love (provided no element\nof self deception be involved) is sworn.\n"}
{"body": "=Intellect and Ethic.=--One must have a good memory to be able to keep\nthe promises one makes. One must have a strong imagination in order to\nfeel sympathy. So closely is ethics connected with intellectual\ncapacity.\n"}
{"body": "=Desire for Vengeance and Vengeance Itself.=--To meditate revenge and\nattain it is tantamount to an attack of fever, that passes away: but to\nmeditate revenge without possessing the strength or courage to attain it\nis tantamount to suffering from a chronic malady, or poisoning of body\nand soul. Ethics, which takes only the motive into account, rates both\ncases alike: people generally estimate the first case as the worst\n(because of the consequences which the deed of vengeance may entail).\nBoth views are short sighted.\n"}
{"body": "=Ability to Wait.=--Ability to wait is so hard to acquire that great\npoets have not disdained to make inability to wait the central motive of\ntheir poems. So Shakespeare in Othello, Sophocles in Ajax, whose suicide\nwould not have seemed to him so imperative had he only been able to cool\nhis ardor for a day, as the oracle foreboded: apparently he would then\nhave repulsed somewhat the fearful whispers of distracted thought and\nhave said to himself: Who has not already, in my situation, mistaken a\nsheep for a hero? is it so extraordinary a thing? On the contrary it is\nsomething universally human: Ajax should thus have soothed himself.\nPassion will not wait: the tragic element in the lives of great men does\nnot generally consist in their conflict with time and the inferiority\nof their fellowmen but in their inability to put off their work a year\nor two: they cannot wait.--In all duels, the friends who advise have but\nto ascertain if the principals can wait: if this be not possible, a duel\nis rational inasmuch as each of the combatants may say: \"either I\ncontinue to live and the other dies instantly, or vice versa.\" To wait\nin such circumstances would be equivalent to the frightful martyrdom of\nenduring dishonor in the presence of him responsible for the dishonor:\nand this can easily cost more anguish than life is worth.\n"}
{"body": "=Glutting Revenge.=--Coarse men, who feel a sense of injury, are in the\nhabit of rating the extent of their injury as high as possible and of\nstating the occasion of it in greatly exaggerated language, in order to\nbe able to feast themselves on the sentiments of hatred and revenge thus\naroused.\n"}
{"body": "=Value of Disparagement.=--Not a few, perhaps the majority of men, find\nit necessary, in order to retain their self esteem and a certain\nuprightness in conduct, to mentally disparage and belittle all the\npeople they know. But as the inferior natures are in the majority and as\na great deal depends upon whether they retain or lose this uprightness,\nso--\n"}
{"body": "=The Man in a Rage.=--We should be on our guard against the man who is\nenraged against us, as against one who has attempted our life, for the\nfact that we still live consists solely in the inability to kill: were\nlooks sufficient, it would have been all up with us long since. To\nreduce anyone to silence by physical manifestations of savagery or by a\nterrorizing process is a relic of under civilization. So, too, that cold\nlook which great personages cast upon their servitors is a remnant of\nthe caste distinction between man and man; a specimen of rude antiquity:\nwomen, the conservers of the old, have maintained this survival, too,\nmore perfectly than men.\n"}
{"body": "=Whither Honesty May Lead.=--Someone once had the bad habit of\nexpressing himself upon occasion, and with perfect honesty, on the\nsubject of the motives of his conduct, which were as good or as bad as\nthe motives of all men. He aroused first disfavor, then suspicion,\nbecame gradually of ill repute and was pronounced a person of whom\nsociety should beware, until at last the law took note of such a\nperverted being for reasons which usually have no weight with it or to\nwhich it closes its eyes. Lack of taciturnity concerning what is\nuniversally held secret, and an irresponsible predisposition to see what\nno one wants to see--oneself--brought him to prison and to early death.\n"}
{"body": "=Punishable, not Punished.=--Our crime against criminals consists in the\nfact that we treat them as rascals.\n"}
{"body": "=Sancta simplicitas of Virtue.=--Every virtue has its privilege: for\nexample, that of contributing its own little bundle of wood to the\nfuneral pyre of one condemned.\n"}
{"body": "=Morality and Consequence.=--Not alone the beholders of an act generally\nestimate the ethical or unethical element in it by the result: no, the\none who performed the act does the same. For the motives and the\nintentions are seldom sufficiently apparent, and amid them the memory\nitself seems to become clouded by the results of the act, so that a man\noften ascribes the wrong motives to his acts or regards the remote\nmotives as the direct ones. Success often imparts to an action all the\nbrilliance and honor of good intention, while failure throws the shadow\nof conscience over the most estimable deeds. Hence arises the familiar\nmaxim of the politician: \"Give me only success: with it I can win all\nthe noble souls over to my side--and make myself noble even in my own\neyes.\"--In like manner will success prove an excellent substitute for a\nbetter argument. To this very day many well educated men think the\ntriumph of Christianity over Greek philosophy is a proof of the superior\ntruth of the former--although in this case it was simply the coarser and\nmore powerful that triumphed over the more delicate and intellectual. As\nregards superiority of truth, it is evident that because of it the\nreviving sciences have connected themselves, point for point, with the\nphilosophy of Epicurus, while Christianity has, point for point,\nrecoiled from it.\n"}
{"body": "=Love and Justice.=--Why is love so highly prized at the expense of\njustice and why are such beautiful things spoken of the former as if it\nwere a far higher entity than the latter? Is the former not palpably a\nfar more stupid thing than the latter?--Certainly, and on that very\naccount so much the more agreeable to everybody: it is blind and has a\nrich horn of plenty out of which it distributes its gifts to everyone,\neven when they are unmerited, even when no thanks are returned. It is\nimpartial like the rain, which according to the bible and experience,\nwets not alone the unjust but, in certain circumstances, the just as\nwell, and to their skins at that.\n"}
{"body": "=Execution.=--How comes it that every execution causes us more pain than\na murder? It is the coolness of the executioner, the painful\npreparation, the perception that here a man is being used as an\ninstrument for the intimidation of others. For the guilt is not punished\neven if there be any: this is ascribable to the teachers, the parents,\nthe environment, in ourselves, not in the murderer--I mean the\npredisposing circumstances.\n"}
{"body": "=Hope.=--Pandora brought the box containing evils and opened it. It was\nthe gift of the gods to men, a gift of most enticing appearance\nexternally and called the \"box of happiness.\" Thereupon all the evils,\n(living, moving things) flew out: from that time to the present they fly\nabout and do ill to men by day and night. One evil only did not fly out\nof the box: Pandora shut the lid at the behest of Zeus and it remained\ninside. Now man has this box of happiness perpetually in the house and\ncongratulates himself upon the treasure inside of it; it is at his\nservice: he grasps it whenever he is so disposed, for he knows not that\nthe box which Pandora brought was a box of evils. Hence he looks upon\nthe one evil still remaining as the greatest source of happiness--it is\nhope.--Zeus intended that man, notwithstanding the evils oppressing him,\nshould continue to live and not rid himself of life, but keep on making\nhimself miserable. For this purpose he bestowed hope upon man: it is, in\ntruth, the greatest of evils for it lengthens the ordeal of man.\n"}
